"""Journal statistics schemas (AT-031 — Journal Statistics & Setup Analytics v1).

Deterministic, record-only aggregates over canonical ``journal_trades`` (AT-030).
Statistics are computed exclusively from recorded values — never from live market
I/O — and carry explicit sample-size confidence and data-coverage warnings so
small or partially populated samples cannot be mistaken for robust evidence.
