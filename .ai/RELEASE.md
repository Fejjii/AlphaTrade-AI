# Workflow: RELEASE / DEPLOY validation

> Authoritative rules: `.ai/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md`. Only commit/push/deploy when the task explicitly
> authorizes it; otherwise stop at `REVIEW_REQUIRED` before the protected action.

## Development checks
```
# backend/
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
# Run tests relevant to the changed behavior (not the complete suite each iteration).
uv run pytest tests/<affected-test>.py
# frontend/
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
```
- Inspect `git status` and full diff; confirm every changed file is intentional.
- Secret scan the diff; confirm no secrets, keys, or private URLs.
- Confirm `render.yaml` preserves paper-safe values: `PROVIDER_MODE=fallback`,
  `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`, `EXCHANGE_MODE=paper_internal`,
  Watcher/Telegram flags `false`.

Ordinary push/PR CI keeps all six job names, dependencies and quality checks.
Backend pytest runs `scripts/run_backend_focused.py`: a small config/deployment/
workflow baseline, changed backend test files, matching module test names and an
explicit SFP/receipt/logging regression group for those paths. This is a development
selection, not exhaustive dependency analysis. For other cross-module changes,
include their focused tests explicitly in the PR; the complete gate below remains
required. A successful focused run is **not complete backend acceptance**.

## Final consolidated release acceptance

After supervising review, consolidated staging deployment and fresh SFP diagnostics/
evaluations, dispatch **one** complete CI run on the exact reviewed release ref:

```sh
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <reviewed-release-ref> -f full_backend=true
```

The Actions UI exposes the same `full_backend` boolean, defaulting to true for
manual dispatch. Ordinary push/PR events always use focused mode. A manual false
value requests development checks only. Do not dispatch a full run during routine
implementation or call a focused green check the complete release gate.

The full dispatch runs unfiltered `uv run pytest` with PostgreSQL and all existing
Ruff, frontend lint/type/unit/build, deployment-safety, Docker build, deterministic
Agent/RAG/guardrail evaluation and Playwright browser smoke checks. Record the run
URL, exact `head_sha`, full backend counts/skips and successful results for all
six jobs. Failed, skipped or cancelled evaluation/browser jobs do not establish
acceptance. Investigate skips and do not attribute counts from another commit.
If the reviewed commit changes, its earlier full result is not final acceptance.

No branch protection configuration, credentials, deployment or activation settings
change through this workflow. Demo stays disarmed and real trading stays disabled.
Live acceptance remains supervised; local/mock checks do not prove it.

## Deploy validation (staging, paper-only)
- `ENV_FILE=.env.staging ./scripts/check-env.sh`
- `BASE_URL=<api> ./scripts/post-deploy-smoke-gate.sh` (AT-005 mandatory gate; exit 0)
- Canonical path: `INCLUDE_CANONICAL=true BASE_URL=<api> ./scripts/post-deploy-smoke-gate.sh`
  or `BASE_URL=<api> ./scripts/canonical-staging-smoke.sh`
- On gate exit 1 → follow `docs/deploy_rollback_runbook.md` before further work
- `BASE_URL=<api> ./scripts/verify-safety.sh` (included in the gate; may run alone)
- `BACKEND_URL=<api> ./scripts/validate-exchange-demo-staging.sh`
- Confirm `/health` paper posture, `real_trading_enabled=false`, Watcher/Telegram false.
- Confirm providers remain mock until an operator manually configures keys.
- Never enable real trading during deploy or rollback.

## Handoff (mandatory end of task)
1. Regenerate `HANDOFF.md` + `CHANGELOG_SESSION.md` from the `.ai/` templates; set the correct
   status (`READY`, or `REVIEW_REQUIRED`/`BLOCKED`/`FAILED` as applicable — never `DRAFT`).
2. Recompute the normalized `Source File SHA256` (hash of each doc with its own
   `Source File SHA256:` line removed) and write it back.
3. Run `~/.local/bin/sync-alphatrade-ai-handoff.sh`.
4. Verify the iCloud destination matches source via SHA256 **and** `cmp`/`diff`; confirm exit
   status 0. Sync immediately on any blocker/review/failure — never wait for task end.
