# AlphaTrade AI — Decisions (ADR log)

Durable, append-only architecture/workflow decisions. IDs: `AT-ADR-XXX`.

---

## AT-ADR-001 — Adopt private `.ai/` collaboration + iCloud handoff workflow
- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Standardize the ChatGPT ↔ Cursor workflow already used for OnePilot AI.
- **Decision:** Add a version-controlled `.ai/` layer and Cursor project rules, plus
  per-session `HANDOFF.md` + `CHANGELOG_SESSION.md` (gitignored) and a content-aware macOS
  iCloud sync (script + LaunchAgent) that mirrors only those generated handoff docs.
- **Consequences:** Consistent, clone-portable handoffs; no application-code or Git-history
  changes; generated handoff artifacts never committed.

## AT-ADR-002 — Version-control governance; keep generated handoffs private
- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Durable governance (`.ai/`, `.cursor/rules/`) must reach every clone, but
  per-session handoffs contain evolving state and should not pollute Git history.
- **Decision:** Track `.ai/` and `.cursor/rules/` in Git. Keep `HANDOFF.md`,
  `CHANGELOG_SESSION.md`, and `*.local.md` gitignored. The generated handoffs are
  mirrored only to iCloud via `sync-alphatrade-ai-handoff.sh` (two lightweight docs).
- **Consequences:** A fresh clone receives the AI instructions and Cursor rules; the
  repo working tree is the source of truth for handoffs and iCloud is a verified mirror.

## AT-ADR-003 — Preserve paper-only trading posture as an invariant
- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Status:** Accepted (pre-existing, reaffirmed)
- **Context:** Safety-critical trading system.
- **Decision:** `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`,
  `EXCHANGE_MODE=paper_internal`, `PROVIDER_MODE=fallback` (staging) are invariants.
  Any change requires a separate, explicitly authorized task.
- **Consequences:** Enforced in `deployment_safety.py` / `exchange_safety.py` and CI.

## AT-ADR-004 — Adopt Master Workflow v2.0 as the authoritative standard
- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Status:** Accepted (supersedes the workflow portions of AT-ADR-001/002)
- **Context:** A consolidated v2.0 standard (`ALPHATRADE_AI_MASTER_WORKFLOW.md`) unifies the
  earlier catch-up prompt and mobile-blocker addendum into one governance document.
- **Decision:** Save it as `.ai/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md` and make it authoritative from `.ai/MASTER.md`.
  Adopt the five-status model (`IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`, `READY`;
  no `DRAFT`), the Mobile Status block + Schema Version 2.0 metadata, the normalized
  `Source File SHA256` self-hash (hash of the doc with its own hash line removed), mandatory
  sync at every phase/blocker/review/failure, and broker/exchange modes A–D (D disabled).
  Keep `HANDOFF.md`/`CHANGELOG_SESSION.md`/`*.local.md` and `.ai/local//.ai/private/` ignored.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep the v1 ad-hoc handoff format (rejected: no blocker/review
  states, hardcoded timezone, body-only hash); embed private material in tracked files (rejected:
  use ignored `.ai/private/` / `.ai/local/`).
- **Safety impact:** None to application behavior; strengthens blocker/review/failure handling and
  reaffirms paper-only posture and disabled real execution (mode D).
- **Consequences:** Templates and Cursor rules updated; installation stops at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`
  before any commit until a human authorizes it.
- **Validation:** `bash -n` sync script, `plutil -lint` LaunchAgent, SHA256 + `cmp`, idempotent
  second sync, secret scan of tracked governance, no app-code changes.
- **Reaffirmation (2026-07-22, AT-000B):** Supplied
  `ALPHATRADE_AI_MASTER_WORKFLOW.md` reinstalled byte-identical
  (SHA256 `4255f52c…`) as `.ai/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md`. Governance reconciled
  (`PROJECT_CONTEXT`, `MASTER.md`, trading-safety Mode A/C wording). No app-code changes.

## AT-ADR-005 — Real-money (Mode D) requires phased program; paper Criticals first
- **Date:** 2026-07-21
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-010 readiness audit found paper-MVP/staging readiness with Critical/High
  gaps (unauth tools, soft data degradation, under-wired risk/kill switch). A real-money
  program must not bypass paper hardening.
- **Decision:**
  1. Keep `main` paper-first; short-lived feature branches only; no long-lived live-trading branch.
  2. Close paper Critical findings (AT-011…AT-014, AT-007) before sandbox execution work.
  3. Mode D follows Phases 0–4 in `docs/AT010_real_money_safety_roadmap.md`; Phase 3–4 require
     separate explicit human authorization beyond ordinary implementation tasks.
  4. Never merge changes that weaken `EXECUTION_MODE=paper` / `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false` defaults.
- **Alternatives considered:** Long-lived live branch (rejected: drift + accidental merge risk);
  implement sandbox immediately (rejected: Critical paper gaps remain).
- **Safety impact:** Strengthens fail-closed path to any future capital; no live trading enabled now.
- **Consequences:** Backlog AT-011…AT-024 added; next slice is AT-011 authz.
- **Validation:** AT-010 deliverables reviewed; staging verify-safety remains paper-only.

## AT-ADR-006 — Staging/production RAG providers fail closed (AT-013)
- **Date:** 2026-07-22
- **Status:** Accepted (implementation pending review/commit authorization)
- **Context:** Silent mock LLM/embeddings and Qdrant→in-memory substitutes created
  split-brain knowledge behavior and false readiness in non-local environments.
- **Decision:**
  1. `provider_fail_closed` for `ENVIRONMENT` in `{staging, production}`.
  2. Staging/production require configured `OPENAI_API_KEY` and hosted `QDRANT_URL`;
     reject `PROVIDER_MODE=mock`.
  3. OpenAI LLM/embeddings and Qdrant refuse silent mock/memory substitutes when
     fail-closed; ingest/search raise clear `ServiceUnavailableError` (no secrets).
  4. Readiness treats critical LLM/embeddings/vector as not ready when unavailable,
     degraded+fallback, or accidentally mock.
  5. Local (and pytest default local settings) retain explicit mocks/soft fallback.
- **Alternatives considered:** Soft degrade with warnings only (rejected: false healthy);
  ban mocks in all environments (rejected: blocks offline local/dev).
- **Safety impact:** Strengthens knowledge integrity; no trading-mode change;
  `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false` preserved.
- **Consequences:** Branch `feat/at-013-rag-provider-fail-closed`; stop at
  `REVIEW_REQUIRED` before commit/push/deploy.
- **Validation:** Scoped ruff/mypy + AT-013/provider/RAG/deployment/health tests (see handoff).

## AT-ADR-008 — Audit/usage unit-of-work + gated RED metrics (AT-016)
- **Date:** 2026-07-22
- **Status:** Accepted (implementation pending review/commit authorization)
- **Context:** AT010-H6 / RR-10 — `AuditService.record` and `UsageService.record`
  called `session.commit()` mid-request on the shared FastAPI Session, splitting
  business durability from audit/usage. No scrapeable RED metrics existed.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Caller / UoW owns commit.** Routes (or application services that already
     commit) perform the authoritative `session.commit()` after business mutation,
     audit flush, and usage flush.
  2. **Audit and usage flush only.** `record()` adds + flushes so IDs (e.g.
     `audit_event_id`) are available before commit; no hidden service-level commit.
     Flush failures that must not wipe prior business rows use a nested savepoint
     via `run_in_savepoint_when_active` — nested only when the DBAPI connection
     already has an open transaction. (SQLite: `RELEASE` of a SAVEPOINT that
     *started* the transaction would otherwise commit.)
  3. **No global auto-commit on `get_session()`** — existing explicit commits remain;
     a blanket teardown commit would surprise tool/worker paths.
  4. **Durable rejected/security events** use explicitly named
     `AuditService.record_durable_isolated()` (dedicated short-lived session +
     commit) after or outside the business transaction — rate-limit, quota block,
     paper reject, kill-switch trigger, auth security events.
  5. **Usage persistence** stays fail-open unless `observability_strict_mode`;
     strict audit flush failures raise and prevent the caller commit.
  6. **RED metrics** via `prometheus-client`: `http_requests_total`,
     `http_request_duration_seconds`, `http_requests_in_progress` with labels
     `method` / `route` (template) / `status_class` only. `METRICS_ENABLED=false`
     by default; outside local, `METRICS_SCRAPE_TOKEN` is required. `/metrics` is
     not observed recursively. Health/ready stay separate.
- **Alternatives considered:** Global commit-on-success in `get_session()` (rejected
  for this slice — too many existing commits); unrestricted public `/metrics`
  (rejected — Render scrape surface); embedding org/user labels (rejected — cardinality
  + privacy).
- **Safety impact:** Stronger atomicity for paper execution/approvals; durable
  security audits preserved; no trading-mode change.
- **Consequences:** Branch `feat/at-016-audit-uow-metrics`; stop at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- **Validation:** `tests/test_at016_audit_uow_metrics.py` + audit/usage/execution/
  approval/risk/auth regressions.
- **Amendment (2026-07-23 — idempotent usage metering):** Route meters
  `paper_execution` only when `PaperOrderPlacementResult.created_new` is true.
  Sequential idempotent replay returns the existing order without a second usage
  row or creation audit. Concurrent first-writers may still race past the lookup
  and hit unique constraints; current contract is unique-conflict + client retry
  (proven in `test_concurrent_identical_requests_remain_safe`). Server-side
  Postgres convergence is AT-028 — not part of this amendment.

## AT-ADR-007 — Honor PROVIDER_MODE + narrative quota + search opacity (AT-015)
- **Date:** 2026-07-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-010 H5/H10 — factory ignored `PROVIDER_MODE=mock` for LLM/embeddings
  when a key was set; `limit_agent_narrative` was unused; search opacity needed UI/tests.
- **Decision:**
  1. Local `PROVIDER_MODE=mock` forces mock LLM/embeddings (and mock dims) even with key.
  2. Staging/production continue to reject `PROVIDER_MODE=mock` (AT-ADR-006 unchanged).
  3. Narrative polish checks `agent_narrative` quota before LLM; hard block → deterministic
     fallback (chat analysis still succeeds; no narrative LLM spend).
  4. Search continues to return `degraded`/`fallback_used`/`vector_backend`; frontend surfaces them.
- **Alternatives considered:** Hard-429 the entire chat on narrative quota (rejected: optional
  polish must not block deterministic analysis); allow mock in staging (rejected: AT-013).
- **Safety impact:** Reduces unexpected OpenAI spend in mock mode; cost control for narrative;
  no trading-mode change.
- **Consequences:** Branch `feat/at-015-provider-mode-quotas`; stop at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- **Validation:** `tests/test_at015_provider_mode_quotas.py` + provider/embedding/AT-013 regressions.

## AT-ADR-009 — Proxy trust, Redis-required rate limits, fail-closed denylist (AT-018)
- **Date:** 2026-07-23
- **Status:** Accepted (implementation pending review/commit authorization)
- **Context:** AT010-H8 / RR-12 — `client_ip()` trusted the leftmost (client-supplied)
  `X-Forwarded-For` entry and uvicorn ran with `--forwarded-allow-ips="*"`, so rate-limit
  identity was spoofable. Staging allowed silent in-memory rate-limit fallback, and the
  token denylist could silently fall back to a process-local store (no cross-instance
  revocation).
- **Decision:**
  1. **Rightmost-hops proxy trust.** New `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` setting (default 0). Only the
     rightmost N `X-Forwarded-For` entries — appended by our own reverse proxies — are
     trusted; entry `[-N]` is the client. 0 ignores the header entirely. Malformed or
     too-short header data falls back to the socket peer address. Staging/production
     require `>= 1` (Render sits behind exactly one proxy); local defaults to 0.
  2. **Uvicorn no longer trusts `*`.** `--forwarded-allow-ips` defaults to loopback and is
     overridable via `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`; client-IP resolution happens in-app.
  3. **Redis-required rate limits outside local.** Staging/production reject
     `RATE_LIMIT_ALLOW_IN_MEMORY_FALLBACK=true` at startup. Runtime Redis errors without
     fallback keep failing closed (HTTP 429), and startup fails fast when Redis is
     unreachable.
  4. **Fail-closed denylist.** Staging/production require the denylist enabled, on Redis,
     and `ACCESS_TOKEN_DENYLIST_FAIL_CLOSED=true`. Outside local, denylist construction
     failure raises (no silent in-memory substitute), revocation writes that cannot be
     persisted raise `TokenDenylistUnavailableError` (HTTP 503), and revocation checks on
     Redis error continue to treat tokens as revoked. Local keeps developer-friendly
     fallback.
- **Alternatives considered:** CIDR allowlist for proxies (rejected: Render proxy IPs are
  not stable/published; hop count is deterministic); trusting uvicorn `--proxy-headers`
  resolution (rejected: with `*` it takes the spoofable leftmost entry); swallowing
  denylist write failures (rejected: a revoked token would silently stay valid).
- **Safety impact:** Rate-limit identity is no longer client-controlled; revocation is
  enforced or explicitly unavailable. No trading-mode change; paper posture preserved.
- **Consequences:** Branch `feat/at-018-proxy-trust-redis`; `render.yaml` staging sets
  `RATE_LIMIT_ALLOW_IN_MEMORY_FALLBACK=false`, `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1`,
  `ACCESS_TOKEN_DENYLIST_FAIL_CLOSED=true` (staging Redis must be reachable at deploy);
  stop at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- **Validation:** `tests/test_rate_limit.py` (proxy trust + spoof regression),
  `tests/test_token_denylist.py`, `tests/test_deployment_safety.py` (AT-018 invariants),
  full backend suite + scoped strict mypy + ruff.

## AT-ADR-010 — Backup/restore RPO/RTO targets for paper staging (AT-019)
- **Date:** 2026-07-23
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT010-H9 / RR-13 — backup/restore RPO/RTO was UNKNOWN; no verified restore
  drill. Postgres is the system of record; Redis is ephemeral; Qdrant is rebuildable.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Postgres RPO ≤ 24h** (stretch ≤ 1h if platform PITR enabled); **RTO ≤ 4h** for
     scratch restore + validation + cutover on staging/paper-MVP.
  2. **Qdrant RPO ≤ 24h or rebuild-from-SoR**; **RTO ≤ 4h** via snapshot or re-ingest.
  3. **Redis:** no logical backup; **RTO ≤ 15m** recreate empty instance.
  4. Local Compose drills are the default verification path; managed/staging restores
     require explicit human approval and prefer scratch DB over in-place overwrite.
  5. Evidence in git must be sanitized (sizes, hashes, durations, pass/fail only).
  6. AT-005 (deploy rollback + smoke gate) remains a separate concern — not duplicated.
- **Alternatives considered:** Require staging restore before closing AT-019 (deferred:
  approval-gated); treat Redis as SoR (rejected: intentionally ephemeral).
- **Safety impact:** Improves recovery preparedness; no trading-mode change; no live
  execution; scripts refuse non-local targets.
- **Consequences:** Runbook + inventory + drill docs under `docs/`; local helpers under
  `scripts/*postgres-local*` / `drill-backup-restore-local.sh`; dumps in `.ai/local/`.
- **Validation:** Tier A local drill passed 2026-07-23; see
  `docs/backup_restore_drill_evidence.md`.

## AT-ADR-011 — Post-deploy smoke gate + deploy rollback procedure (AT-005)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged PR #15 → `main` @ `f145599`)
- **Context:** Rollback was informal checklist rows; no automated fail-closed post-deploy
  gate. AT-019 covers data restore; app revision rollback and smoke gating were still open.
- **Decision:**
  1. Mandatory post-deploy command is `scripts/post-deploy-smoke-gate.sh`, which always
     runs `verify-safety.sh` and (default `GATE_PROFILE=standard`) `staging-smoke.sh`.
  2. Gate exit codes: `0` pass, `1` rollback trigger, `2` misconfiguration.
  3. Document exact triggers/steps/verification/failure handling in
     `docs/deploy_rollback_runbook.md`; wire into staging checklist/runbook/`RELEASE.md`.
  4. CI `deployment-safety` job asserts the gate is executable and `--self-check` passes
     (no network / no staging deploy from CI).
  5. The gate never deploys, never enables real trading, and never mutates platform services.
- **Alternatives considered:** Rely on manual `verify-safety` only (rejected: easy to skip);
  auto-rollback via Render API from CI (rejected: requires credentials + deploy authority
  outside ordinary impl tasks).
- **Safety impact:** Stronger fail-closed deploy acceptance; paper-only invariants unchanged.
- **Consequences:** Operators must treat gate exit `1` as a hard rollback trigger; data
  restore remains AT-019.
- **Validation:** `post-deploy-smoke-gate.sh --self-check`; unit tests in
  `tests/test_deployment_scripts.py`; docs present and cross-linked.

## AT-ADR-012 — Canonical journal trade domain links existing records (AT-030)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged via PR #16)
- **Context:** Trade data is fragmented across proposal-flow positions, paper-validation
  trades, backtest trades, and manual session records; the legacy `journals` table is
  reflection-only and typed to the built-in `StrategyId` enum. There was no canonical
  trade identity, no first-class MFE/MAE or available-vs-realized profit, and no
  structured rule-compliance or behavioral-observation records.
- **Decision:**
  1. **One canonical entity, `journal_trades`**, tenant-scoped, covering all sources
     (`manual`, `paper_execution`, `paper_validation`, `backtest`, `imported`, `system`)
     with plan fields (thesis, trigger, entry plan, invalidation, stop, targets, runner),
     execution fields (entry/exit, size, leverage, fees, funding, slippage, PnL), market
     regime, and excursion metrics (MFE/MAE, available vs realized).
  2. **Link, never copy.** FKs to positions, paper trades, proposals, orders, backtest
     trades, paper validation runs, and legacy journal entries; setup/strategy provenance
     via existing immutable `SetupDefinition` (name+version) and `UserStrategyVersion`.
     All links validated against the caller's organization; mismatches return 404
     (fail closed, no existence leak).
  3. **Child tables** for evidence (`journal_trade_evidence`), rule compliance
     (`journal_trade_rule_checks`), and behavioral observations
     (`journal_trade_observations`) instead of free-text lists.
  4. **Record-only.** No execution authority: never read by the engine, scheduler, or
     risk gates; excursion metrics accept deterministic inputs only (manual now, candle
     replay later) — no live market I/O in the journal path.
  5. **Legacy `/journal/entries` API and RAG sync stay unchanged**; canonical trades
     mount on the same router under `/journal/trades`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Extending `TradeJournal` in place (rejected: schema is
  reflection-shaped, enum-typed to legacy strategies, and widely consumed); a separate
  standalone journal service/app (rejected: would disconnect from tenancy, audit, RBAC,
  and existing records); computing MFE/MAE live at read time (rejected: nondeterministic,
  provider-dependent, violates freshness/conservatism rules).
- **Safety impact:** No trading-mode change; paper posture preserved; all mutations
  audited (`JOURNAL_TRADE_*` events); no new secrets or providers.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `i5d6e7f8a9b0`; follow-up slices (statistics,
  replay, human-vs-system endpoint, backtest integration, import/backfill) build on this
  domain — see `docs/journal_intelligence_foundation.md`.
- **Validation:** Migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade on Postgres 16; 13 new API tests;
  full backend suite exit 0; ruff clean; strict mypy clean on all new modules.

## AT-ADR-013 — Journal statistics: deterministic aggregates over recorded values (AT-031)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged via PR #17)
- **Context:** AT-030 established canonical `journal_trades` but there were no statistics
  over it. Statistics must be trustworthy on small, partially populated samples: paper
  tenants have few trades, and MFE/MAE, planned risk, fees, and available-profit are only
  sometimes recorded.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Extend the AT-030 journal architecture** — statistics queries live on
     `JournalTradeRepository`, computation in a dedicated `JournalStatisticsService`,
     one authorized endpoint `GET /journal/statistics` on the journal router. No separate
     analytics system, no rollup tables in this slice.
  2. **Closed trades only; recorded values only.** SQL selects a bounded narrow
     projection (`journal_stats_max_rows`, default 5000, stable oldest-first ordering
     with truncation flagging); metric arithmetic runs in Python with `Decimal` for
     deterministic, dialect-independent precision (SQLite tests ≙ Postgres prod).
  3. **Per-family sample counts + confidence.** Every metric family (PnL, R, costs,
     MFE/MAE, available-vs-realized) aggregates only trades that recorded those values
     and reports its own sample count; `None` is never silently reported as zero.
     Coarse confidence labels (<5 insufficient, <20 low, <50 moderate, ≥50 high) and
     machine-readable warnings accompany every result.
  4. **Derived dimensions are conservative.** Rule compliance per trade = worst recorded
     assessment (`violated` > `partial` > `compliant`; no checks ⇒ `unassessed`, never
     compliant). Human-vs-system = decision authority mapping from `source`
     (`manual`/`imported`/`paper_execution` ⇒ human; `paper_validation`/`backtest`/
     `system` ⇒ system).
  5. **Win/loss classification**: recorded `result` wins; closed trades left at
     `result=open` fall back to the recorded `net_pnl` sign (the same arithmetic AT-030
     applies at close); win rate = wins / (wins + losses), breakeven excluded.
- **Alternatives considered:** Pure SQL conditional aggregation (rejected: float
  arithmetic on SQLite diverges from Postgres `numeric`, and per-family sample logic
  becomes unreadable); extending `UnifiedTradeLoader` (rejected for this slice: it loads
  positions/paper trades, not canonical journal trades — journal statistics must read the
  canonical table so all sources are covered uniformly); precomputed rollup tables
  (rejected: premature — bounded on-demand scans suffice at current volumes and cannot
  drift from source data).
- **Safety impact:** Read-only endpoint (`ReaderDep`), tenant-scoped (org + user); no
  execution-path changes; no live market I/O; reads not audited, mutations remain audited
  via AT-030; paper posture unchanged.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `j6e7f8a9b0c1` (index-only migration). Replay
  slice (deterministic MFE/MAE from candles) will raise excursion coverage; backtest
  integration reuses these grouping dimensions.
- **Validation:** Migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade on Postgres 16 scratch DB; 19 new
  API tests; ruff clean; strict mypy clean on new modules; frontend tsc + eslint + page
  test green.

## AT-ADR-014 — Journal excursion replay from HistoricalCandle (AT-032)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged via PR #18)
- **Context:** AT-030 stored excursion columns but values were only manual; AT-031
  aggregates recorded MFE/MAE / available-profit with per-family sample counts, so
  coverage stays low until a deterministic fill path exists. Live market fetches at
  read time were rejected in AT-ADR-012.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Pure calculator + audited replay service.** In-trade MFE/MAE / available profit
     are computed from stored `HistoricalCandle` OHLC overlapping `[entry, exit)`
     (exit exclusive). Long and short use mirrored extremes. Amounts require size;
     capture percent reuses AT-030 arithmetic.
  2. **Read-only market data.** Replay never ingests or calls providers; missing
     candles / invalid windows skip safely with limitations. Gaps and incomplete
     coverage set freshness flags (`excursion_is_stale`, notes) without inventing bars.
  3. **Overwrite policy is explicit and deterministic.** Default `skip_protected`
     writes only when `excursion_source` is empty or already `replay`. `manual` and
     `system` (and any other non-replay source) require `overwrite_policy=force`.
  4. **Provenance columns** on `journal_trades` record data source, staleness, gap
     count, window completeness, and `excursion_computed_at`. Persisted source is
     always `replay`. Mutations audit as `JOURNAL_TRADE_EXCURSION_REPLAYED`.
  5. **Post-exit runner analysis** reuses `RunnerAndMissedProfitAnalyzer` in the
     response only — it does not redefine in-trade `available_profit`.
  6. **AT-031 integration** is automatic: statistics read recorded amounts; replay
     raises sample coverage without changing aggregate semantics.
- **Alternatives considered:** Computing MFE/MAE at statistics read time (rejected:
  nondeterministic if candles change; couples reads to market store); always
  overwriting manual values (rejected: human-entered coaching data must stay
  protected); provider fetch during replay (rejected: violates record-only /
  freshness rules for this slice).
- **Safety impact:** Record-only; `TraderDep` mutations; tenant-scoped; bounded
  candle/batch limits; paper posture unchanged; no live trading.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `k7f8a9b0c1d2`. Remaining journal slices:
  completion/import, human-vs-system endpoint, backtest bulk journal + full
  deterministic backtesting coverage.
- **Validation:** Migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade on Postgres 16 scratch DB; 17 new
  API tests; ruff clean; strict mypy clean on new modules; CI run 30105918952 success
  (backend 1259 passed / 1 skipped).

## AT-ADR-015 — Journal completion: import dedup, backfill, auto-journal, attachments (AT-033)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged PR #19, merge `ad66dca`, CI run 30114440476 success)
- **Context:** AT-030/031/032 built the canonical journal, statistics, and excursion
  replay, but records only entered via manual API calls. The completion slice needs
  bulk history import, legacy `TradeJournal` migration, automatic journaling on paper
  closes, and a storage answer for screenshots/evidence — with idempotency, tenant
  isolation, audit, and human-vs-system analytics preserved.
- **Decision:**
  1. **DB-enforced dedup via partial unique index.** `(organization_id, external_ref)
     WHERE external_ref IS NOT NULL` on `journal_trades`. App-level checks give
     friendly per-row `duplicate` outcomes; the index is the race-proof backstop.
     Import rows without a ref get a deterministic `fp-sha256:` fingerprint over
     normalized identity fields, so re-imports are idempotent either way.
  2. **All-or-nothing import commit as the recovery model.** `mode=dry_run` previews
     per-row outcomes; `mode=commit` persists nothing when any row is invalid
     (single unit of work). Recovery is "fix and re-run" — duplicates skip safely.
     Committed batches persist to `journal_import_batches` for reconciliation
     history and audit (`JOURNAL_IMPORT_COMPLETED`).
  3. **`entry_method` column for human-vs-system analytics.**
     `manual|auto|import|backfill`, orthogonal to `source` (a human from-position
     record and an auto-hook record share `source=paper_execution` but differ in
     entry_method). First-class AT-031 filter + `group_by` dimension.
  4. **Backfill is a CLI script, dry-run by default.**
     `scripts/backfill_journal_entries.py` maps legacy rows to
     `source=imported`/`entry_method=backfill` with
     `external_ref='legacy-journal:<id>'` + `linked_journal_entry_id`; legacy rows
     are never mutated (link-never-copy, AT-ADR-012 upheld).
  5. **Auto-journal hooks are opt-in global Settings flags, fail-safe for the
     close.** `journal_auto_from_position_close` /
     `journal_auto_from_paper_validation`, both default false. Hooks reuse the
     idempotent `create_from_*` prefills inside a savepoint and swallow all errors
     after a warning log — journaling can never block or roll back a close.
     Paper-validation records attribute to the run owner.
  6. **Attachments are DB-backed behind an interface.** Bytes live in
     `journal_trade_attachments.content` (Postgres) with strict caps (5 MiB, MIME
     whitelist, 20/trade) because no durable object store exists and Render disks
     are ephemeral; existing DB backups cover them. `AttachmentStorage` keeps an
     S3-style swap schema-free. Uploads auto-link `JournalTradeEvidence`
     (`ref='attachment:<id>'`).
- **Alternatives considered:** Per-row partial import commits (rejected: ambiguous
  recovery semantics; idempotent re-run is simpler); per-user auto-journal preference
  (rejected for now: no preferences model exists — would be scope creep; global flags
  documented as deferred work); local-filesystem or S3 attachment storage (rejected:
  ephemeral Render disk loses data / no object store provisioned; interface keeps the
  door open); making `external_ref` globally unique across sources only for
  `imported` (rejected: org-wide partial index gives idempotency to backfill and
  future integrations too).
- **Safety impact:** Record-only throughout; no execution-path change; new flags
  default off; mutations `TraderDep`, reads `ReaderDep`; org-scoped fail-closed
  lookups; attachment validation fail-closed; paper posture unchanged; no live
  trading.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `l8a9b0c1d2e3`. Deferred: attachment upload
  UI (needs a trades detail page), per-user auto-journal opt-in, persisting
  failed/dry-run batches (enum values reserved).
- **Validation:** Migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade round-trip on disposable
  Postgres 16 (docker); partial unique index verified on Postgres (duplicate
  rejected, NULLs unconstrained); 44 new backend tests (import 14, backfill 6,
  attachments 12, auto-journal 9, integration 3) plus AT-030/031/032 regression
  green; frontend 267 tests + typecheck + build green; ruff clean. No deploy.

## AT-ADR-016 — Deterministic backtesting v1: snapshot+hash reproducibility, conservative intra-bar rule, evidence tiers, bounded orchestration without new queue infra (AT-034)
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted (merged via PRs #20–#23 → `main` @ `8f9a84b`)
- **Context:** AT-030–033 established canonical journal trades, statistics, excursion
  replay, and bulk import. Slice 35 introduced a simpler backtest engine. AT-034
  needs reproducible historical simulation that journals into the canonical trade
  store, supports walk-forward evaluation, and surfaces advisory evidence — without
  new async infrastructure, live trading paths, or parameter-optimization loops.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Frozen config + dataset snapshots.** On create, persist `config_snapshot`,
     `config_hash`, and link an immutable `backtest_datasets` row by `dataset_hash`.
     Candles are hash-referenced, not copied per run.
  2. **Pure engine + `result_hash`.** `BacktestEngineService` (v2,
     `ENGINE_VERSION=at034-2.0.0`) is deterministic; `result_hash` is canonical JSON
     SHA-256. `POST /backtests/{id}/verify` re-runs with `persist=False` and
     compares hashes after dataset integrity check.
  3. **Conservative intra-bar rule.** When stop and TP both touch in one bar, stop
     wins.
  4. **Walk-forward v1 only.** Holdout and rolling splits evaluate independent
     segments with per-split and OOS metrics — no parameter optimization across
     windows.
  5. **Bounded orchestration.** Sync path when `total_bars <= backtest_sync_max_bars`;
     otherwise `QUEUED` with existing worker loop (1 run/cycle) plus BackgroundTasks
     fallback when worker disabled. Refuse `total_bars > backtest_max_bars` (no
     truncation). Cancel every 2000 bars; idempotency keys; active-run cap per org.
  6. **Bulk journal + comparison + advisory tiers.** `POST /backtests/{id}/journal-trades`
     creates `source=backtest` rows with dedup `external_ref`. `GET /journal/comparison`
     exposes human/paper_system/backtest cohorts. `GET /journal/setup-evidence` assigns
     tier1/tier2/tier3 from configurable OOS and confirmation thresholds — advisory
     only, never execution authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Celery/dedicated queue (rejected: existing worker +
  BackgroundTasks suffice for bounded workloads); storing full candle copies per run
  (rejected: immutable hash-referenced datasets); parameter-optimizing walk-forward
  (rejected for v1: windowed evaluation only); using backtest tiers to gate live
  trading (rejected: record-only, risk engine untouched).
- **Safety impact:** Record-only throughout; paper posture unchanged; advisory tiers
  never feed execution or risk; mutations `TraderDep`; tenant-scoped; no live orders.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `m9b0c1d2e3f4`. Docs rewritten in
  `docs/backtesting.md`. Integration tests in `test_at034_integration.py`.
- **Validation:** Merged PRs #20–#23 (CI runs 30126077064, 30126107532,
  30130869273, 30130870524 all success). Post-merge on `main` @ `8f9a84b`:
  AT-034 + slice-35 pytest 43 passed; frontend page tests 7 passed; ruff clean.
  No deploy.

## AT-ADR-017 — Research validation loop: extend candidate provenance + synthetic alert/draft vs parallel queue (AT-035)
- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-034 delivers deterministic backtests, OOS metrics, and advisory
  setup evidence tiers. Slice 80 established the paper validation candidate queue
  (alert → draft → candidate). Users need a paper-safe path to promote strong
  backtest evidence into that queue without bypassing FK constraints or creating a
  parallel promotion system.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Reuse existing candidate queue.** Promotion enters `paper_validation_candidates`
     via the same queue model — no separate research queue or execution shortcut.
  2. **Synthetic research-origin alert + draft.** Create
     `PaperAlertType.RESEARCH_VALIDATION_PROMOTION` alert and a `ready_for_validation`
     draft to satisfy non-null `source_alert_id` / `draft_id` FKs; mark
     `promotion_source=research_validation`.
  3. **Eligibility via `SetupEvidenceService`.** Tier1/tier2 eligible; tier3 hard
     blocked. Missing OOS metrics or incomplete runs blocked. Soft warning
     `insufficient_confirm_sample` when confirm trades below tier1 threshold.
  4. **Frozen provenance on candidate.** Persist `backtest_run_id`, strategy/version
     FKs, dataset/config/result hashes, `evidence_tier`, and `evidence_snapshot`
     JSON at promotion time. Legacy alert-draft rows keep nullable provenance.
  5. **Idempotency.** Partial unique index on
     `(organization_id, backtest_run_id)` for active (`queued`/`reviewing`) candidates.
  6. **Confirm phrase.** `PROMOTE_RESEARCH_VALIDATION_CANDIDATE` required on POST.
  7. **Paper-only.** Advisory endpoints; never feed execution or risk; tenant-scoped;
     `ReaderDep` for evidence/status, `TraderDep` for promote.
- **Alternatives considered:** Parallel research-only queue (rejected: duplicates
  review UX and splits paper validation); nullable alert/draft FKs (rejected: breaks
  existing schema invariants); auto-start paper runtime on promote (rejected: exceeds
  advisory scope and weakens human review).
- **Safety impact:** Record-only; paper posture unchanged; no risk/execution module
  changes; promotion does not authorize live trading.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head moves to `n0c1d2e3f4a5`. Docs in
  `docs/research_validation.md`. Tests in `test_at035_research_validation.py`.
- **Validation:** Disposable Postgres 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade cycle;
  partial unique index verified; duplicate active promotion blocked at DB layer;
  targeted pytest + ruff + frontend research-validation tests; CI on merge PR.

## AT-ADR-018 — Aggregate journal comparison decision quality vs per-trade HumanVsSystemService (AT-036)
- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-034 delivers three-cohort journal comparison (`human`,
  `paper_system`, `backtest`) over closed canonical trades. Users need aggregate
  decision-quality metrics (entry timing, early exits, missed profit, capture) and
  human-vs-system actor scorecards without invoking per-trade
  `HumanVsSystemService` orchestration on every list request. Slice 36
  `/human-vs-system/{id}` remains the per-trade analyzer surface.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Extend existing endpoint.** Add AT-036 fields to `GET /journal/comparison`
     — backward compatible; preserve AT-034 `cohorts` with three keys.
  2. **Recorded fields only.** Decision quality computed from journal columns
     (`planned_entry_price`, `entry_price`, `direction`, `available_profit`,
     `net_pnl`, `realized_vs_available_pct`) — no live market I/O, no proposal
     linkage required for aggregates.
  3. **Actor scorecards.** `human` = manual + imported + paper_execution;
     `system` = paper_validation + backtest + system (decision-authority mapping
     from AT-031).
  4. **Dimension buckets.** `by_entry_method`, `by_source`, `rule_compliance`
     (worst-assessment), plus capped setup/regime `breakdowns`.
  5. **Warnings.** Reuse AT-031 confidence thresholds; add `PARTIAL_TIMING_DATA`
     and `PARTIAL_MISSED_PROFIT_DATA` when subsamples are partial.
  6. **Frontend paths in `links`.** Echo filters for journal statistics and
     comparison; link to research-validation and paper-validation candidates.
  7. **Paper-only / ReaderDep.** Advisory record-only; never feeds execution or
     risk; tenant-scoped like AT-034.
- **Alternatives considered:** New dedicated endpoint (rejected: fragments
  comparison UX and duplicates filters); invoke `HumanVsSystemService` per trade in
  list (rejected: heavy, needs proposal links, exceeds aggregate scope); replace
  Slice 36 per-trade API (rejected: different granularity and analyzer depth).
- **Safety impact:** Record-only; paper posture unchanged; no risk/execution
  module changes.
- **Consequences:** No migration required (reuses AT-031/034 indexes and journal
  columns). Docs in `docs/journal_intelligence_foundation.md` §7,
  `docs/human_vs_system.md`, `docs/backtesting.md`. Tests in
  `test_at036_journal_comparison.py` and frontend comparison page tests.
- **Validation:** Targeted backend + frontend tests on feature branch; no deploy.

## AT-ADR-019 — TradingView signed intake + BloFin demo read-only sync (AT-037)
- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** TradingView alerts need a secure multi-tenant intake path into the
  paper-first workflow, and operators need BloFin **demo** account/position
  visibility without any order mutation. Existing paper-validation candidates
  require non-null alert/draft FKs (AT-035 synthetic scaffold pattern). Billing
  webhooks prove HMAC+timestamp+idempotency patterns but lack tenant signal
  lifecycle and public rate limits.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Signed public webhook.** `POST /webhooks/tradingview` with
     `X-AT-Timestamp` + `X-AT-Signature` (HMAC-SHA256 over `{timestamp}.{body}`),
     skew window, fail-closed when disabled/secret missing, public IP rate limit.
  2. **Dedicated `tradingview_signals` table.** Org-scoped lifecycle
     (`received`/`validated`/`rejected`/`duplicate`/`candidate_created`),
     unique `(org, idempotency_key)` and `(org, alert_id)`, redacted payload
     storage, optional links to setup/strategy/journal/backtest/candidate.
  3. **Optional paper candidate only.** Explicit trader confirm
     (`CREATE_TRADINGVIEW_PAPER_CANDIDATE`) creates synthetic alert+draft+queued
     candidate with `promotion_source=tradingview_signal`. Auto-create off by
     default. Never creates live orders or executable proposals.
  4. **BloFin sync is read-only demo.** Persist bounded snapshots via
     `get_demo_account_provider` only; provenance + health + stale marking;
     no execution provider calls; secrets never logged.
  5. **Frontend.** Signal inbox + exchange BloFin sync panel with loading/empty/
     stale/error states.
- **Alternatives considered:** Reuse billing `webhook_events` only (rejected:
  no signal lifecycle/links); make alert FK nullable on candidates (rejected:
  breaks Slice 80 invariants — use synthetic scaffold); auto-queue every alert
  (rejected: opt-in confirm / setting); live BloFin sync (rejected: Mode D /
  safety).
- **Safety impact:** Paper/demo only; real trading stays disabled; no order
  placement/cancel/modify; rate limits/denylist/kill-switch unchanged.
- **Consequences:** Migration `o1d2e3f4a5b6`; docs in
  `docs/tradingview_blofin_sync.md`; tests in `test_at037_tradingview_blofin.py`
  + frontend page/panel tests.
- **Validation:** Targeted backend + frontend tests on feature branch; no deploy.

## AT-ADR-020 — Automated paper-signal orchestration (AT-038)
- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-037 delivers signed TradingView intake and optional manual
  paper-candidate creation. Operators need a deterministic, reviewable bridge from
  validated signals into paper-validation candidates/run plans and (optionally)
  approval-gated paper proposals — without any live or autonomous execution path.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Dedicated decision table.** `paper_signal_orchestration_decisions` with
     unique `(org, tradingview_signal_id)` idempotency, status state machine,
     eligibility/risk evidence JSON, transition history, and links to signal /
     setup / strategy / journal / backtest / candidate / run plan / proposal.
  2. **Configurable human modes only.** `observe_only` | `candidate_only` |
     `approval_required`. No autonomous live mode. Default disabled + observe_only.
  3. **Reuse existing paper pathways.** Candidates via AT-037
     `_create_candidate_internal`; run plans via Slice 81 confirm pathway;
     paper proposals via `ProposalService.create(approval_required=True)`.
     Never call `place_paper_order` or exchange mutation APIs.
  4. **Fail-closed gates.** Freshness, timeframe, direction, confidence, setup/
     strategy linkage when configured, level consistency, conflicting-signal
     window, market-context (when BloFin demo enabled), kill switch, daily-loss
     lock, cooldown after loss, `execution_mode=paper`, `enable_real_trading=false`.
  5. **Explicit proposal confirm.** `APPROVE_PAPER_SIGNAL_PROPOSAL` required in
     `approval_required` mode; re-validate eligibility before proposal create.
- **Alternatives considered:** Auto-place paper orders from signals (rejected:
  bypasses approval/risk); extend TradingView signal status instead of a decision
  table (rejected: conflates intake lifecycle with orchestration); live mode
  (rejected: Mode D / safety).
- **Safety impact:** Paper-only; real trading stays disabled; kill switch /
  cooldown / daily-loss / approval controls remain authoritative.
- **Consequences:** Migration `p2e3f4a5b6c7`; docs in
  `docs/paper_signal_orchestration.md`; tests in
  `test_at038_paper_signal_orchestration.py` + frontend page tests.
- **Validation:** Targeted backend + frontend tests on feature branch; no deploy.

## AT-ADR-021 — Phase 5 Binance USD-M perpetual evidence contracts (no spot fallback)
- **Date:** 2026-09-16
- **Status:** Accepted (implemented on PR #80, draft; do not merge pending independent review)
- **Context:** The first BTCUSDT vertical slice requires closed perpetual 15m/4h OHLCV,
  ordered USD-M aggregate trades, quote-volume CVD, and signed quote flow. The existing
  `binance-public` adapter uses spot `/api/v3/klines` and may silently fall back to mock
  data. Architecture §17/§25 forbid forming-candle confirmation, spot substitution, and
  unresolved reconnect gaps.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Separate perpetual evidence package** (`app.market_contracts`) with typed venue,
     market, instrument, source, provider, interval, finality, revision, timestamps,
     freshness, content hash, and provenance. Phase 1 execution modules are not modified.
  2. **Preferred source is Binance USD-M public REST** (`fapi.binance.com` klines +
     aggTrades). GET-only path allowlist. No API keys. No order/position/account paths.
  3. **No spot fallback and no mock substitute** for live USD-M evidence. Regional
     unavailability fails closed (`RegionalProviderFailureError`) and reports
     `using_fallback=false`.
  4. **FINAL candles only.** Forming klines are represented but cannot enter a
     `ClosedOhlcvSeries`. First slice requires 100 final 15m and 30 final 4h bars.
  5. **Trade stream cursor** is `INITIAL -> CONTINUOUS -> RECONNECTING -> RECOVERED`.
     Every reconnect starts a new epoch. Unresolved sequence gaps are
     `UNRECOVERABLE` and fail closed. Cross-connection CVD windows are not supported.
  6. **CVD** is unrounded Decimal quote volume: buyer aggressor `+price*qty*multiplier`,
     seller aggressor negative. Baseline is 0 at the open of the 32nd 15m bar before
     trigger T. Signed flow is `signed_quote_delta / total_quote_volume` on the trigger
     bar. Binance aggressor convention is `m=true` ⇒ seller aggressor (`buyer-is-maker/v1`).
  7. **Default runtime source is replay fixtures** (`PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE=replay`)
     so local/CI never require Binance reachability. Replay is explicitly mock, not a
     silent live fallback.
  8. **AggTrades retrieval** chunks `startTime`/`endTime` to < 1 hour and paginates
     further pages with `fromId` only. Mixed time+fromId queries are forbidden.
     Incomplete pages or sequence holes fail closed.
  9. **CVD completeness** is derived from a `TradeStreamSnapshot` plus immutable
     `TradeWindowCoverageProof`. The proof binds exact market/source identity,
     lineage, requested/actual half-open bounds, gap/completeness state, terminal
     trade identities, ordered trade-set hash, and content hash. It must cover the
     entire T-32 through trigger-end window. Count and internal continuity alone
     are insufficient. First-slice action eligibility also requires terminal trade
     freshness ≤10s.
  10. **Live evidence hosts** are explicit approved USD-M HTTPS identities
      (`fapi.binance.com`). Arbitrary hosts and `http://` are rejected.
  11. **End-to-end identity** requires every normalized trade to exactly match the
      stream market/instrument and represented source fields. CVD/flow identity must
      exactly equal the authoritative snapshot identity.
  12. **Signed quote flow** consumes the same proven stream as CVD and requires
      complete trigger-bar coverage, no gap, matching lineage/aggressor convention,
      and fresh terminal evidence. Raw trade lists are not accepted.
- **Alternatives considered:** Relabel the existing spot kline adapter as perpetual
  (rejected: incompatible market); fall back to spot or mock when USD-M is blocked
  (rejected: false evidence); persist observations in this phase (rejected: no migration
  unless unavoidable; later phases own candidate/observation storage).
- **Safety impact:** Read-only market evidence only; no execution path change;
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false` and `EXECUTION_MODE=paper` unchanged.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/market_source_contracts.md`; tests in
  `test_phase5_*.py`. Pattern/fusion/watcher remain out of scope.
- **Validation:** Targeted Phase 5 pytest, full backend pytest, ruff, scoped mypy.

## AT-ADR-022 — Isolated watcher orchestration foundation (typed persistence)
- **Date:** 2026-09-16
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Phase 7 watcher work is split across parallel agents. This agent
  owns worker orchestration (leases, fencing, lineage, retry, health, scheduling)
  without market semantics, candidates, Telegram, execution, journal, or ORM
  migrations. Agent 1 later supplies source freshness and evidence validity.
- **Decision:**
  1. New isolated package `app.watcher` with typed persistence ports and a
     deterministic in-memory repository for this wave.
  2. Manual and worker callers share one `WatcherOrchestrator.evaluate` boundary
     (`PREVIEW | PERSIST_EVIDENCE | PERSIST_AND_NOTIFY`). Notify stays blocked.
  3. One fenced worker owns a tenant-scoped scan key `(organization_id, scan_scope)`;
     stale fence holders cannot publish. `scan_scope` strings are not a tenant boundary.
  4. Every scan has an immutable lineage; attempts are append-only; retries are
     idempotent; failures cannot be rewritten as successes.
  5. Health is exclusive `healthy | degraded | blocked | stale`.
  6. `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED` defaults false and is not wired into the
     live worker loop. No shared ORM model or Alembic changes.
  7. WatcherStore methods take `organization_id` explicitly and reject organization
     mismatch. Lease, fence, heartbeat, health, latest-attempt-by-scope, and
     lineage-by-scope are keyed by `(organization_id, scan_scope)`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Extend `MarketWatcherService` / SQLAlchemy models
  now (rejected: collides with parallel agents and premature PostgreSQL binding);
  process-local locks only (rejected: architecture requires monotonic lease
  epochs on every worker-caused write).
- **Safety impact:** Watcher stays disabled; no automatic trading or candidate
  creation; real trading remains disabled.
- **Consequences:** Later integration review binds the ports to PostgreSQL after
  all three parallel PRs land.
- **Validation:** `backend/tests/test_watcher_orchestration_foundation.py`.

## AT-ADR-023 — Isolated Telegram security protocol; APPROVE never executes (AT-043)
- **Date:** 2026-09-16
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Agentic redesign §10 requires verified private-chat enrollment,
  opaque action nonces, receipts, replay protection, and a RemoteActionGateway
  that is not a second mutation stack. Agent 3 owns the isolated security
  foundation only. Telegram must remain disabled and must not connect to
  execution. CLOSE stays unavailable. EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN is out of scope.
- **Decision:**
  1. **Isolated package.** `app.telegram_security` holds enrollment, binding,
     message/callback identity, nonce, receipt, rate-limit, outbox, delivery
     acknowledgement, transport, and the action authorization boundary.
  2. **Persistence interfaces only.** `TelegramSecurityStore` + deterministic
     `InMemoryTelegramSecurityStore`. No shared ORM models, no Alembic.
  3. **Disabled by default.** `telegram_interaction_enabled=false`. No FastAPI
     webhook. Fake transport for tests; no live Telegram API calls.
  4. **Private chat only.** Group/channel chats and chat-id-only enrollment fail.
  5. **Opaque one-time nonces** bind org, user, account, Telegram identity, resource,
     revision/content hash, one action, expiry, and single-use state.
  6. **APPROVE** records a protocol-level authorization intent (`executes=false`).
     It never calls ExecutionService. EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN is not in the Telegram
     vocabulary.
  7. **CLOSE** is a known name but unavailable (issue and apply both fail).
  8. Duplicate `update_id` / `callback_query_id` / outbox idempotency keys
     converge only when the inbound semantic fingerprint is identical. Same
     transport lookup identity with changed update/message/callback identity,
     Telegram user, chat, chat type, bot, nonce or enrollment-token hash,
     action, organization, AlphaTrade user, account, resource, revision,
     content hash, or payload hash fails closed as `REPLAY_CONFLICT`.
  9. Inbound type and size validation precede receipt lookup. Exact persisted
     replay convergence and conflicting replay rejection precede rate-limit
     charging; only genuinely new semantic inbound actions consume budget.
  10. `MAX_INBOUND_UPDATE_BYTES` is enforced against
     `TelegramInboundUpdate.body_size` (raw Telegram request payload), never
     nonce or enrollment-token length. Webhook wiring remains out of scope.
  11. Delivery is at-least-once via durable claim.
- **Alternatives considered:** Wire inbound webhook now (rejected: later
  integration); persist via Alembic in this slice (rejected: later PostgreSQL
  binding); allow APPROVE to call execution (rejected: CRITICAL-03).
- **Safety impact:** Telegram stays off. Live trading stays disabled. Approval
  cannot execute. CLOSE cannot close.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/telegram_security_protocol.md`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_telegram_security_protocol.py`.
- **Validation:** Targeted protocol tests, full backend pytest, ruff, mypy on
  `app.telegram_security`, GitHub CI. No merge in the implementing PR's agent
  instructions.

## AT-ADR-024 — Phase 6 canonical signal-fusion contract freeze
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (contracts only; evaluator/persistence not in this slice)
- **Context:** Parallel Phase 6 implementation needs one typed identity and hash
  layer so observations, fusion, assessment, candidates, eligibility, adapters,
  and PostgreSQL persistence cannot invent competing schemas.
- **Decision:**
  1. Canonical package is `app.signal_fusion`. Phase 5
     `PublicMarketObservation` and market identities are reused, not duplicated.
  2. Freeze immutable contracts: `FusionPolicy`, `SetupAssessment`,
     `ActionEligibility`, `Candidate`, `CandidateTransition`, and
     `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1`.
  3. Setup truth lifecycle is `NO_SETUP -> WATCH -> PARTIAL_MATCH ->
     CONFIRMED_SETUP` or market-only `INVALIDATED`/`EXPIRED`. Risk/account
     state cannot occupy `SetupAssessment`.
  4. Confirmed candidates start `ACTIVE`. Terminal `REJECTED`/`SKIPPED`/
     `EXPIRED`/`INVALIDATED` cannot resurrect to `ACTIVE`.
  5. Candidate uniqueness is the §5 tuple; `setup_definition_id` is a
     tenant-owned `CompiledSetupDefinition` only.
  6. `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1` hashes the §26 semantic preimage with
     canonical Decimal/datetime serialization and deterministic ordering.
     Transport metadata and presentation evidence are excluded.
  7. This slice does not implement the fusion evaluator, candidate repository,
     Alembic, watcher/Telegram/TradingView adapters, risk evaluation, alerts,
     outbox, execution, or frontend.
- **Alternatives considered:** New observation identity in fusion (rejected:
  Phase 5 already owns public observations); persist candidates now (rejected:
  contract freeze only); let adapters keep source-specific candidate keys
  (rejected: equivalent watcher/detector/TradingView evidence must converge).
- **Safety impact:** Paper mode unchanged. No network, execution, watcher,
  Telegram, or BloFin calls.
- **Consequences:** Later Phase 6 agents implement evaluator, persistence, and
  adapters against this package.
- **Hardening (2026-09-17, PR #84):** Fail-closed selected-observation
  venue/market/instrument matching; role-aware timeframes (trigger vs context
  may differ); tenant assertions enter CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1 only when
  required or explicitly selected by FusionPolicy; duplicate semantic set
  members are canonicalized; Phase 5 `observation_id_for` is revision-aware
  (`source_event_id|finality|revision`) so FORMING, FINAL, and corrected
  revisions are distinct immutable appends. No evaluator, persistence, or
  live trading.


## AT-ADR-025 — Phase 6 deterministic first-slice fusion evaluator
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (setup-truth evaluator only)
- **Context:** PR 84 froze identities. Setup truth still had no deterministic
  evaluator. Parallel agents must not invent a second identity or let risk
  rewrite pattern presence.
- **Decision:**
  1. `evaluate_setup(policy, command, evidence, evaluated_at)` is the sole
     first-slice setup-truth function. It reuses PR 84 contracts and Phase 5
     payloads; it does not create `Candidate` or `ActionEligibility`.
  2. Canonical pattern name remains **Bearish Liquidity Sweep with CVD
     Divergence and Aggressive Sell Imbalance at 4h Resistance**. The first
     slice makes no exhaustion claim.
  3. States are only `NO_SETUP`, `WATCH`, `PARTIAL_MATCH`, `CONFIRMED_SETUP`,
     `INVALIDATED`, `EXPIRED`. Risk, account, leverage, balance, portfolio,
     and execution availability cannot alter `SetupAssessment`.
  4. Confirmation requires every mandatory Boolean predicate (equal weight,
     threshold `1.0`): identity, finality, freshness ≤ 10s, no gap, warmup,
     Wilder ATR14, confirmed L2/R2 swing `S`, nearest versioned 4h resistance
     `R` with `abs(S-R) <= 0.50 ATR4h`, sweep/close, volume ≥ 1.50, bearish
     quote-volume CVD divergence, aggressive sell imbalance ≤ -0.10.
  5. Invalidation is `T.high + max(0.10 ATR15m, 2 * tick)`; expiry is two
     additional final 15m bars. Fail closed on wrong market/instrument/venue,
     forming/stale/missing evidence, unresolved gap, wrong perpetual identity,
     incomplete warmup, missing/invalid manual resistance, incompatible policy.
  6. Evidence order and adapter kind (watcher vs detector) must not change
     the assessment. Equivalent semantic evidence hashes identically via
     `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Interpret a generic AST VM now (rejected: first
  slice is one compiled pattern); persist candidates in this slice (rejected:
  evaluator owns truth only); let account/risk fields veto setup (rejected:
  eligibility is a later contract).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No exchange, execution, Telegram, watcher, or
  deployment calls.
- **Consequences:** Candidate persistence and action eligibility remain later
  Phase 6 slices against the same frozen identities.

## AT-ADR-026 — Phase 6 candidate lifecycle service (in-memory authority)
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (application service; PostgreSQL/Alembic not in this slice)
- **Context:** PR #84 froze Candidate / CandidateUniquenessTuple / transitions.
  Parallel persistence work must not invent a second candidate authority.
  PaperValidationCandidate remains a downstream queue (§26).
- **Decision:**
  1. Canonical candidate authority is `CandidateLifecycleService`.
  2. Creation requires SetupAssessment `CONFIRMED_SETUP` plus the exact
     `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1` plus the tenant-owned
     `CompiledSetupDefinition` identity. NO_SETUP / WATCH / PARTIAL_MATCH /
     EXPIRED / INVALIDATED cannot mint ACTIVE candidates.
  3. Uniqueness is exactly `CandidateUniquenessTuple`. Duplicate semantic
     confirmations converge, including concurrent inserts. Distinct org,
     strategy version, compiled setup, fusion policy version, direction,
     venue, market, instrument, timeframe, or evidence-window hash do not
     converge.
  4. Initial state is ACTIVE. Descendants are PLAN_CREATED and terminal
     REJECTED / SKIPPED / EXPIRED / INVALIDATED. Terminal states cannot
     resurrect. History is append-only.
  5. Persistence is a typed `CandidateRepository` port with deterministic
     `InMemoryCandidateRepository` only. No SQLAlchemy models, no Alembic,
     no fusion evaluator, no watcher/Telegram/execution wiring.
  6. Legacy `PaperValidationCandidate` cannot create canonical identity.
  7. **Idempotency (integration hardening):** organization-scoped creation
     `idempotency_key` binds to the canonical uniqueness fingerprint. Exact
     retries converge; same key with a different payload fails closed.
     Transition idempotency is candidate-scoped: exact key+payload replay
     returns the original record; key reuse with a changed payload fails
     closed. A different key requesting an already-applied state converges
     only when the semantic fingerprint matches the original transition.
- **Alternatives considered:** Persist PostgreSQL in this slice (rejected:
  separate durable-persistence agent); derive candidates from PVC or
  TradingView signals (rejected: competing authority).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No network, execution, feature flags, or
  live trading.
- **Consequences:** Later Phase 6 agents bind PostgreSQL to the same port
  without changing uniqueness or lifecycle rules.

## AT-ADR-027 — Phase 6 evaluator + candidate runtime foundation integration
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (in-memory runtime foundation only)
- **Context:** Main already contains Phase 6 contracts, compatibility audit,
  and the golden first-slice fixture corpus. PR #87 owns setup truth. PR #86
  owns candidate authority. They must share one package without rewriting
  frozen contracts or restoring removed fixture-specific semantic hashing.
- **Decision:**
  1. Integrate evaluator and candidate lifecycle additively onto current
     main. Do not change CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1, SetupAssessment,
     Candidate, or the golden fixture corpus.
  2. Canonical strategy name remains **Bearish Liquidity Sweep with CVD
     Divergence and Aggressive Sell Imbalance at 4h Resistance**.
  3. Evaluator never creates candidates. Combined flow is composition:
     evidence → `evaluate_setup` → CONFIRMED_SETUP → exactly one ACTIVE
     candidate. Duplicate semantic evaluation converges.
  4. Golden fixtures remain the authoritative corpus in
     `backend/tests/fixtures/phase6_first_slice/`. Evaluator/candidate
     tests adapt to current support APIs; they do not overwrite fixtures.
  5. No PostgreSQL, Alembic, watcher, Telegram, eligibility, TradePlan,
     execution, frontend, or live trading.
- **Alternatives considered:** Merge PR 86/87 fixture support over the
  corpus (rejected: corpus on main is authoritative); couple evaluator to
  candidate creation (rejected: separate authorities).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No external calls, execution, or deployment.
- **Consequences:** Independent integration review is the next gate. Draft
  PR only; do not merge in the implementing agent instructions.

## AT-ADR-028 — Phase 6 deterministic ActionEligibility service
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (in-memory eligibility authority only)
- **Context:** Frozen `ActionEligibility` binds identity and state but does not
  evaluate. SetupAssessment is market truth. A confirmed Candidate still must
  not proceed toward paper TradePlan creation until account, risk, safety,
  configuration, stale action evidence, and first-slice cross-venue basis are
  checked without rewriting setup history.
- **Decision:**
  1. `ActionEligibilityService.evaluate` is the sole first-slice action gate.
     It consumes a canonical Candidate, SetupAssessment lineage, account,
     portfolio, risk snapshot, safety snapshot, market-action evidence, and
     paper execution configuration. It does not create Candidates, mutate
     SetupAssessment, create TradePlanRevision, reserve risk, consume
     approval, or call venues.
  2. Frozen `ActionEligibilityState` remains `ELIGIBLE | BLOCKED | EXPIRED`.
     Finer distinctions are `EligibilityReasonCode` values. Kill switch maps
     to `BLOCKED_KILL_SWITCH` and always dominates. Daily loss and weekly loss
     use Phase 1 `check_daily_loss_lock` / `check_weekly_loss`. Capacity uses
     `RiskEngine.limits.max_position_pct_of_equity`. Account/tenant isolation
     maps to `BLOCKED_ACCOUNT_STATE`. Stale required action evidence maps to
     `BLOCKED_DATA_QUALITY`. Cross-venue basis above 20 bps maps to
     `BLOCKED_BASIS` and never changes SetupAssessment. Live/real-trading
     configuration maps to `BLOCKED_CONFIGURATION`. Non-confirmed setup maps
     to `BLOCKED_SETUP_NOT_CONFIRMED`.
  3. First-slice cross-venue basis threshold is 20 bps (`>` blocks; `<=`
     eligible). Basis is an eligibility gate only.
  4. Identical semantic evaluation converges on one immutable record.
     Changed risk snapshot identity or safety epoch appends a distinct
     evaluation revision without mutating history.
  5. `live_executable` is always false. `paper_actionable` is true only for
     `ELIGIBLE` under paper configuration. Persistence remains in-memory.
- **Alternatives considered:** New ActionEligibilityState values such as
  `BLOCKED_SAFETY` (rejected: frozen contract already has ELIGIBLE/BLOCKED/
  EXPIRED); evaluating eligibility inside `evaluate_setup` (rejected: setup
  truth must stay independent); constructing TradePlan to probe risk size
  (rejected: this slice ends at eligibility truth).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Kill switch remains the Phase 1 authority.
  Real trading cannot become executable. No network, Telegram, watcher,
  Alembic, or deployment.
- **Consequences:** Later slices may bind PostgreSQL and feed ELIGIBLE results
  into paper TradePlan creation. Draft PR only; do not merge.

## AT-ADR-029 — Watcher orchestration wires to Phase 6 fusion (first slice)
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (orchestration wiring only)
- **Context:** PR #88 integrated `evaluate_setup` and `CandidateLifecycleService`
  on frozen contracts. Watcher orchestration still used a scripted evaluation
  boundary that forbade all candidate IDs. Manual and worker scans must consume
  the same deterministic evidence and evaluator without a second identity.
  Wave B integration assigned this ADR `AT-ADR-029` because PR 90 already
  occupied `AT-ADR-028` for ActionEligibility.
- **Decision:**
  1. One typed service, `WatcherFusionEvaluationService`, implements
     `WatcherEvaluationBoundary`. Watcher does not implement trading predicates.
  2. Flow is scan evidence → `evidence_window_from_assessment_command` →
     `evaluate_setup` → `SetupAssessment` → `CandidateLifecycleService` only
     when state is `CONFIRMED_SETUP` and mode is `PERSIST_EVIDENCE`.
  3. Watcher does not compute a second evidence hash and does not mint
     candidate IDs. CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1 and CandidateLifecycleService
     remain identity authorities.
  4. NO_SETUP, WATCH, PARTIAL_MATCH, INVALIDATED, and EXPIRED do not create
     an ACTIVE candidate. Duplicate semantic scans converge. Organization
     isolation remains `(organization_id, scan_scope)` plus the candidate
     uniqueness tuple.
  5. SetupAssessment stays market truth only. Balance, portfolio, risk,
     leverage, execution availability, and account state are not inputs.
     Action eligibility, TradePlan, Telegram, execution, Alembic, and a
     second WatcherStore adapter are out of scope.
  6. Persistence remains the existing WatcherStore port (in-memory now;
     PostgreSQL owned by PR #85). `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED` and
     `MARKET_WATCHER_ENABLED` stay false. No scheduler activation.
  7. Orchestrator honesty still rejects unverified candidate IDs. Canonical
     publication requires SUCCEEDED, reason `confirmed_setup`, a 64-hex
     `evidence_validity_token`, and exactly one candidate id.
- **Alternatives considered:** Put predicates in WatcherOrchestrator
  (rejected: second evaluator); mint watcher-scoped candidate IDs (rejected:
  competing identity); create candidates on PREVIEW (rejected: dry-run);
  mix ActionEligibility into SetupAssessment (rejected: setup vs action).
- **Safety impact:** Watcher remains disabled. Paper only. No live trading,
  exchange mutation, Telegram, or deployment.
- **Consequences:** Draft PR only; do not merge. Later work may bind a live
  market-evidence adapter and PostgreSQL WatcherStore without changing this
  evaluation boundary.

## AT-ADR-030 — Phase 6 Candidate Telegram alert foundation
- **Date:** 2026-09-17
- **Status:** Accepted (composition foundation; Telegram remains disabled)
- **Context:** Canonical Candidate authority (AT-ADR-026/027) and the isolated
  Telegram security protocol (AT-ADR-023) both exist. Alerts must not treat
  PaperValidationCandidate, PaperSignal, SetupDetection, or TradingViewSignal
  as independent candidate authorities. APPROVE must never execute. Wave B
  integration assigned this ADR `AT-ADR-030` because `AT-ADR-028` is
  ActionEligibility and `AT-ADR-029` is watcher fusion wiring.
- **Decision:**
  1. New package `app.candidate_alerts` composes Candidate -> deterministic
     `CandidateAlertIntent` -> existing Telegram outbox -> secured actions.
  2. Identity binds organization, user, account, candidate ID, candidate
     content hash, strategy version, compiled setup identity, fusion policy
     version, evidence window hash, lifecycle revision, alert kind, and
     Telegram channel. Duplicate semantic events converge. Revision/content
     changes produce a distinct identity.
  3. Structured alert facts are canonical only. No profitability claims.
     No LLM-authored setup truth.
  4. APPROVE stays authorization intent (`executes=false`). REJECT/SKIP map
     to `CandidateLifecycleService` through the gateway. REDUCE_RISK emits
     typed intent and does not mutate Candidate. EXPLAIN/SHOW_CHART/STATUS
     are read-only. CLOSE remains unavailable. EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN is absent.
  5. Reuse `TelegramSecurityStore` / in-memory protocol store. No new
     PostgreSQL adapter, no Alembic, no webhook, no Telegram network call.
     PR 85 remains durable Telegram persistence owner.
  6. `TELEGRAM_INTERACTION_ENABLED=false`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`,
     `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Alert from PaperValidationCandidate or
  TradingViewSignal (rejected: competing authority); extend TelegramSecurityStore
  with alert tables (rejected: second persistence model); let APPROVE call
  execution (rejected: CRITICAL-03).
- **Safety impact:** Telegram stays off. Live trading stays disabled. Approval
  cannot execute. Candidate immutability is preserved for REDUCE_RISK and
  read-only actions.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase6_candidate_telegram_alerts.md`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_phase6_candidate_telegram_alerts.py`.
- **Validation:** Candidate alert tests, Telegram protocol tests, Phase 6
  Candidate tests, full backend pytest, ruff, mypy `--strict` on the new
  package plus `app.telegram_security` and `app.signal_fusion`, GitHub CI.
  Draft PR only; do not merge in the implementing agent instructions.

## AT-ADR-031 — Phase 6 canonical Candidate PostgreSQL persistence
- **Date:** 2026-09-18
- **Status:** Accepted (PostgreSQL adapter; not wired into staging/production)
- **Context:** AT-ADR-026 froze CandidateLifecycleService as the only Candidate
  authority with an in-memory `CandidateRepository`. Durable uniqueness,
  append-only transitions, and the remaining Watcher persist-after-lease-loss
  race require a PostgreSQL adapter that cannot become a second authority.
- **Decision:**
  1. `PostgresCandidateRepository` implements the existing
     `CandidateRepository` port. `CandidateLifecycleService` remains the only
     Candidate authority. In-memory remains the unit-test default.
  2. Projections persist in `canonical_candidates`. Creation idempotency,
     append-only transitions, and transition-key aliases are separate tables
     with uniqueness constraints matching in-memory semantics.
  3. Worker-originated writes bind Watcher lease identity. The Candidate
     persist transaction `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks
     `watcher_worker_leases (organization_id, scan_scope)` and proves current
     owner, epoch, fencing token, and a non-expired lease before committing
     Candidate authority. A stale worker cannot persist after losing its lease.
  4. One Alembic revision from head `3ec264f9aaa8`. Adapters are constructed
     explicitly and are not imported by FastAPI, workers, or feature flags.
  5. `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`, `MARKET_WATCHER_ENABLED`,
     `TELEGRAM_INTERACTION_ENABLED`, and live trading remain disabled.
- **Alternatives considered:** Check fence then persist in a later transaction
  (rejected: TOCTOU); put Candidate identity in WatcherStore (rejected: second
  authority); change TradePlan / ActionEligibility / SetupAssessment (out of
  scope).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No Watcher, Telegram, or live-trading
  activation.
- **Consequences:** Tests in `backend/tests/test_phase6_candidate_postgres.py`.
  Migration `4fd8c1a90b27`.

## AT-ADR-032 — Phase 7 canonical TradePlanRevision application layer
- **Date:** 2026-09-18
- **Status:** Accepted (application layer; durable PostgreSQL binding follows)
- **Context:** Phase 6 froze Candidate and ActionEligibility as in-memory
  authorities. Phase 1 `TradePlanRevision` is hash-stable and immutable, but
  `ProposalService.create_revision` is fail-closed and
  `trade_plan_revisions.candidate_id` still foreign-keys
  `paper_validation_candidates`. PR 93 owned the application layer. Source PR
  claimed `AT-ADR-031`, already used by Candidate PostgreSQL, so this ADR is
  `AT-ADR-032`.
- **Decision:**
  1. `CanonicalTradePlanService.create` is the sole first-slice plan authority.
  2. Creation loads Candidate and ActionEligibility from those services. Only
     `ACTIVE` + currently paper-actionable `ELIGIBLE` may insert. Lineage
     (org/user/account, candidate identity/hash/revision, assessment, evidence
     window, strategy/setup, venue/market/instrument/timeframe/side) must match
     exactly. Plan `candidate_id` is the canonical Candidate id.
  3. Phase 1 `TradePlanRevisionSemantic` / `CanonicalTradePlanContentV1` stays
     hash-stable. Canonical binding is `CanonicalTradePlanLineage` beside that
     preimage, not new semantic fields.
  4. Identical semantic requests converge (presentation/correlation first-write
     wins). Conflicting organization-scoped idempotency fails closed. One plan
     per (org, user, account, candidate) in this slice.
  5. `CandidateState.PLAN_CREATED` is applied only after a successful store
     insert; failed creates do not transition. Transition identity is derived
     from plan uniqueness so retries converge.
  6. `PaperValidationCandidate` and `ProposalService.create_revision` cannot
     mint canonical plan authority. Approval may bind revision id + content
     hash only and cannot change executable semantics. Execution is absent.
  7. Application persistence is `CanonicalTradePlanStore`. Source PR used an
     unbound SQLAlchemy adapter because the PVC FK was still in place. Phase 7
     integration owns the durable remap after Candidate migration `4fd8c1a90b27`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Add lineage fields to `TradePlanRevisionSemantic`
  (rejected: would break existing Phase 1 content-hash verification); write
  canonical UUID5 ids into the PVC FK (rejected: competing identity, FK
  violation).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Live trading cannot become executable. No
  network, Watcher, Telegram, Journal, execution dispatch, frontend, or
  deployment changes.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase7_canonical_trade_plan_binding.md`.
  Tests in `backend/tests/test_phase7_canonical_trade_plan.py`.
- **Validation:** Focused canonical plan tests, Phase 1 planning/approval
  tests, Phase 6 candidate/eligibility tests, full backend pytest, ruff,
  mypy `--strict`, GitHub CI. Draft PR only; do not merge.

## AT-ADR-033 — Phase 7 learning attribution reuses journal projector
- **Date:** 2026-09-18
- **Status:** Accepted (application service; PostgreSQL/Alembic not in this slice)
- **Context:** Phase 4 already converges one execution lifecycle to one
  `JournalTrade`. Phase 6 froze SetupAssessment/Candidate/TradePlan identity.
  Learning analytics still summarize the older paper-validation funnel. This
  wave must connect canonical lifecycle to learning without a second trading
  authority or competing migration. Source PR 95 claimed `AT-ADR-031`, already
  used by Candidate PostgreSQL, so this ADR is `AT-ADR-033`.
- **Decision:**
  1. `JournalLifecycleProjector` remains the only JournalTrade writer.
  2. `LearningAttributionService` / `JournalLifecycleLearningService` are
     record-only consumers. They copy lineage; they do not evaluate setups,
     create candidates, authorize plans, or dispatch execution.
  3. Lineage rides on append-only `payload.lineage`. First-seen values are
     sticky. Duplicate source identity converges. Conflicting identity and
     cross-tenant attribution fail closed.
  4. REJECT/SKIP never create executed trade outcomes. Quality axes are
     planned setup vs execution vs trader behavior. PnL cannot rewrite
     SetupAssessment hashes. LLM narrative is excluded from `facts_hash`.
  5. Lesson/analytics/RAG adapters consume facts. Lessons are suggestions
     only. RAG is a renderer only. No shared schema changes in this wave.
- **Alternatives considered:** New journal trade writer for learning (rejected:
  competing authority); Alembic columns in this wave (rejected: Candidate and
  TradePlan migrations already occupy the Alembic head); auto-persisting
  lessons or RAG ingest (rejected: review workflow and market-truth integrity).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No live trading, Watcher, Telegram, frontend,
  or execution-dispatch changes.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase7_learning_attribution.md`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_learning_attribution.py` and
  `backend/tests/test_journal_lifecycle_lineage.py`.
- **Validation:** Targeted attribution/journal/learning pytest, full backend
  pytest, ruff, mypy `--strict` on the new package plus journal lifecycle
  modules, GitHub CI. Draft PR only; do not merge.

## AT-ADR-034 — Phase 7 canonical TradePlan / ActionEligibility PostgreSQL binding
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (PostgreSQL adapter; not wired into staging/production)
- **Context:** AT-ADR-032 froze CanonicalTradePlanService as the only first-slice
  plan authority with an in-memory store. `trade_plan_revisions.candidate_id`
  still foreign-keyed `paper_validation_candidates`. ActionEligibility was
  in-memory only. Candidate PostgreSQL (AT-ADR-031 / Alembic `4fd8c1a90b27`)
  landed first.
- **Decision:**
  1. Next Alembic revision is `c9e2b4a1d078` after `4fd8c1a90b27`.
  2. `PostgresActionEligibilityStore` implements `ActionEligibilityStore`.
     Evaluations are immutable and keyed by uniqueness hash. Identity bindings
     fail closed. Candidate rows are locked so revision history is append-safe.
  3. `trade_plan_revisions` keeps `candidate_id` as an unconstrained UUID for
     legacy PVC-backed rows. Discriminator `plan_authority` is
     `paper_validation` (canonical_candidate_id NULL) or `canonical`
     (canonical_candidate_id = candidate_id, FK canonical_candidates).
     Legacy PVC ids are never reinterpreted as canonical Candidate ids.
  4. Canonical rows bind `compiled_setup_definition_id` to tenant-owned
     `compiled_setup_definitions`. Global SetupDefinition FK is dropped.
  5. `canonical_trade_plan_lineage` stores Candidate/eligibility hashes beside
     unchanged `semantic_payload`. Uniqueness hash is unique. Idempotency keys
     are organization-scoped.
  6. Canonical `plan_id` remains UUID5(org, user, account, candidate_id). A
     compatibility TradeProposal with `plan_root_kind=canonical_plan_root`
     satisfies the existing composite FK without restoring ProposalService as
     plan authority.
  7. Plan insert locks the canonical Candidate and runs `PLAN_CREATED` in the
     same transaction via `on_inserted`. Adapters are not imported by FastAPI,
     workers, or feature flags. Execution remains a later slice.
- **Alternatives considered:** Backfill PVC ids as canonical Candidate ids
  (rejected: competing identity); put lineage fields into
  TradePlanRevisionSemantic (rejected: would break Phase 1 hashes); delete
  canonical rows on Alembic downgrade automatically (rejected: fail closed if
  canonical rows exist).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay
  disabled. No exchange mutation. No deployment.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase7_canonical_trade_plan_binding.md`.
  Tests in `backend/tests/test_phase7_eligibility_postgres.py` and
  `backend/tests/test_phase7_trade_plan_postgres.py`. Migration `c9e2b4a1d078`.

## AT-ADR-035 — Phase 8 learning attribution PostgreSQL persistence
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (PostgreSQL adapter; FastAPI/runtime wiring owned by later Phase 8 slices)
- **Context:** AT-ADR-033 froze record-only learning attribution on
  `JournalLifecycleProjector` with an in-memory store. Canonical trade outcomes
  still could not be queried as durable strategy/pattern intelligence. Agent 1's
  persistence contract lived in `AGENT_1_ATTRIBUTION_INTEGRATION`.
- **Decision:**
  1. Next Alembic revision is `d4f7a2c8e901` after `c9e2b4a1d078`.
  2. `learning_attribution_records` is the candidate-scoped aggregate
     (`UNIQUE(organization_id, candidate_id)`). Partial unique
     `(organization_id, execution_lifecycle_id)` when set. Events are append-only
     and unique on the same source identity as journal projection receipts.
  3. `PostgresAttributionStore` implements `AttributionStore` on the caller's
     session. Duplicate source identity converges. Conflicting identity, sticky
     lineage, and cross-tenant access fail closed.
  4. Quality axes remain separate: setup quality, execution quality, risk
     adherence, trader behavior, and outcome. REJECT/SKIP cannot become executed
     outcomes. PnL cannot rewrite SetupAssessment or evidence-window hashes.
  5. `learning_venue_mode` is `paper_internal` or `paper_exchange_demo` so future
     demo trade learning does not mix with internal paper stats. Live/real is
     not a venue.
  6. `LearningQueryService` is the read API for strategy/pattern stats,
     human-versus-system comparison, lesson suggestions (`persist=false`), and
     RAG evidence documents. Narrative is labeled `NARRATIVE_NOT_FACT` and is
     excluded from `facts_hash`. RagService is not called.
  7. Optional `journal_trades` lineage columns are projector-stamped query
     helpers. The projector remains the only JournalTrade writer. Slice 84
     paper-validation learning analytics is not replaced.
- **Alternatives considered:** Materialized stats table as a second authority
  (rejected: derive stats from records); auto-ingest learning narrative to Qdrant
  (rejected: market-truth and lesson-review integrity); FastAPI/worker wiring
  (rejected: out of scope for this slice).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No live trading, Watcher, Telegram, frontend, or
  execution-dispatch changes in this slice.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase8_learning_persistence.md`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_phase8_learning_persistence.py`. Migration `d4f7a2c8e901`.
- **Validation:** Attribution/idempotency/tenant/RAG-boundary tests, Alembic
  upgrade/downgrade/reupgrade and single head, full backend pytest, ruff, mypy
  `--strict`, GitHub CI. Source PR #97; integrated on
  `cursor/phase8_final_integration`.

## AT-ADR-036 — Phase 8 canonical PAPER runtime execution
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (runtime composition; paper execution only)
- **Context:** AT-ADR-034 bound Candidate, ActionEligibility, and canonical
  TradePlanRevision to PostgreSQL without FastAPI or worker wiring. Phase 1
  `EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN` already claims `paper_validation` plans. Canonical plans
  must not become ProposalService trading authority. Source PR #99 claimed
  `AT-ADR-035`, already used by learning persistence, so this ADR is
  `AT-ADR-036`.
- **Decision:**
  1. `ProductionCanonicalRuntime` is the production composition for PostgreSQL
     Candidate, ActionEligibility, and CanonicalTradePlan adapters.
     `CandidateLifecycleService` remains the only Candidate authority.
  2. FastAPI lifespan stores the runtime on `app.state`. Request handlers bind
     the caller's Session. The worker constructs the same runtime and never
     starts Watcher or Telegram. Flags default false.
  3. `ExecutionService.execute_paper_plan` routes `plan_authority=canonical` to
     `CanonicalPaperExecutionService`. That path re-verifies Candidate,
     eligibility, plan hash, approval, and account lineage immediately before
     the existing `PaperPlanClaimService` claim transaction. Kill switch and
     `evaluate_claim_predicate` remain final. Authorization is not consumed on
     `BLOCKED`.
  4. Canonical execution is PAPER only. `live_executable` stays false. No
     exchange mutation. Duplicate idempotency keys converge across restarts.
     Stale, rejected, expired, mismatched, or modified plans fail closed.
  5. Compatibility `canonical_plan_root` TradeProposal rows remain FK-only.
     ProposalService create always writes `analysis_proposal`. List omits
     canonical roots. Get/update paths raise `TradingPolicyError`.
  6. Journal lifecycle receives deterministic `approved_plan` / `fill` events
     with `source_system=canonical_paper_execution` via
     `JournalLifecycleProjector`. Exact replay converges.
  7. HTTP `POST /execution/paper-plan` accepts only identity + idempotency.
     Executable fields are forbidden. Legacy `POST /execution/paper` stays
     fail-closed and must not mint canonical Candidate or TradePlan authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Making ProposalService the canonical plan
  authority (rejected: competing authority); enabling Watcher/Telegram with
  this wave (rejected: explicitly out of scope); new Alembic (rejected: Phase 7
  schema plus PR97 learning migration are sufficient).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay
  disabled. No real exchange mutation. No deployment.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/phase8_runtime_execution.md`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_phase8_runtime_composition.py` and
  `backend/tests/test_phase8_canonical_paper_execution.py`.
- **Validation:** Adversarial execution pytest, full backend pytest, ruff,
  scoped `mypy --strict` on Phase 8 modules, deployment-safety, relevant HTTP
  E2E, GitHub CI. Source PR #99; integrated on
  `cursor/phase8_final_integration`.

## AT-ADR-037 — Canonical paper decision frontend (user-facing workflow)
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (frontend composition; no backend authority invented)
- **Context:** Redesign architecture §14/§15 Phase 12 consolidates surfaces.
  Backend Phase 6/7 Candidate, ActionEligibility, TradePlanRevision, and
  ExecutionReceipt exist as services/stores. Source PR #98 claimed
  `AT-ADR-035`, already used by learning persistence, so this ADR is
  `AT-ADR-037`.
- **Decision:**
  1. Plan landing is `/decision`. Legacy `/workspace`, `/proposals`,
     `/approvals`, and `/paper-validation/*` stay reachable.
  2. Market quality and action eligibility are separate cards. Setup quality
     never grants permission to act.
  3. Canonical TradePlan execution binds to `POST /execution/paper-plan`
     with identity + idempotency only. Legacy `POST /execution/paper` remains
     compatibility-only and must not execute a canonical TradePlan.
  4. Canonical reads reuse existing authorities: candidates, setup
     assessment, action eligibility, execution receipt, and
     `LearningQueryService` strategy/pattern statistics. Missing HTTP is
     added as a thin read adapter, not a second domain model.
  5. PaperValidationCandidate is a compatibility projection, not
     CandidateLifecycleService. `canonical_plan_root` stays invisible to
     ProposalService trading authority.
  6. Human approval records authorization only. AI copy cannot claim to
     approve or execute. No live execution control is rendered.
  7. Kill switch and paper/real-trading posture are on every decision screen.
     LLM never becomes deterministic authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Treat PVC as canonical Candidate (rejected:
  AT-ADR-026); keep `POST /execution/paper` as the decision-hub execute path
  (rejected: AT-ADR-036 fail-closed); hide legacy Plan routes (rejected: keep
  functional until telemetry justifies deprecation).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay
  disabled. No real exchange mutation. No deployment.
- **Consequences:** Docs in `docs/redesign/phase8_canonical_frontend.md`.
  Frontend module `frontend/src/lib/canonical-decision/`.

## AT-ADR-038 — Phase 8 release-candidate integration
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (integration; draft PR only; do not merge or deploy)
- **Context:** PR97, PR99, and PR98 landed independently on `main@cd9087a`.
  All three claimed AT-ADR-035 / AT-055. Canonical frontend executed through
  legacy `POST /execution/paper`. Runtime learning used in-memory attribution.
- **Decision:**
  1. Integration order is PR97 → PR99 → PR98. Do not merge `main`.
  2. ADR/task IDs remap to AT-ADR-035/AT-055 (learning), AT-ADR-036/AT-056
     (runtime), AT-ADR-037/AT-057 (frontend).
  3. Alembic remains a single head: `d4f7a2c8e901` after `c9e2b4a1d078`.
  4. Canonical frontend execution binds to `POST /execution/paper-plan`.
  5. Thin `/canonical/*` read APIs reuse Candidate, ActionEligibility,
     ExecutionReceipt, and `LearningQueryService`. No duplicate domain models.
  6. Runtime paper execution attributes through `PostgresAttributionStore`.
  7. Paper only. Watcher and Telegram stay disabled. Kill switch and risk
     BLOCK stay final. Human approval is mandatory. LLM is never authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Merge into `main` in this wave (rejected);
  create another Alembic revision (rejected: not required).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No deploy. No real exchange mutation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/phase8_final_integration`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_phase8_canonical_workflow.py`.

## AT-ADR-039 — Final backend hardening fail-closed attribution and deployment pins
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** After Phase 8 integration (`main@c39dca6`), ALLOW journal projection
  could silently skip learning when Candidate or ActionEligibility lookup returned
  `None`. `PaperExecutionRiskGate` remains unused on `EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN`. Staging
  deployment safety logged Telegram flags but did not reject Watcher/Telegram enablement.
- **Decision:**
  1. Missing Candidate, eligibility, or required assessment lineage after ALLOW
     raises `LearningAttributionIncompleteError` and rolls back the claim/journal
     unit of work. Learning evidence is never silently skipped.
  2. Claim-time final risk authority remains `evaluate_claim_predicate` under
     locked safety-epoch and `AccountRiskAccountingState`, plus canonical lineage
     revalidation including persisted ActionEligibility TTL. Do not integrate
     unused `PaperExecutionRiskGate` as a competing claim authority.
  3. `POST /execution/paper-plan` commits replay requests without double-metering
     usage so healing writes persist.
  4. Canonical fill projection fails closed when the command/plan is missing or
     the production canonical runtime is unbound on a canonical plan.
  5. Staging/production reject Watcher and Telegram enablement flags. Accidental
     real trading remains impossible via existing paper/deployment/exchange
     invariants (`real_trading_enabled` is permanently false).
- **Alternatives considered:** Persist a separate attribution-failure row while
  committing ALLOW (rejected for this slice: would split execution from learning);
  wire `PaperExecutionRiskGate` into claim (rejected: second risk authority).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay disabled.
  No deploy.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_backend_hardening`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_phase8_backend_hardening.py`. Draft PR
  https://github.com/Fejjii/AlphaTrade-AI/pull/102 (do not merge). Integrated on
  `cursor/final_release_integration-c461`.

## AT-ADR-040 — Staging/production refuse Watcher and Telegram enablement
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Phase 8 canonical architecture is paper-ready. Watcher and Telegram
  defaulted false but were not locked, so a staging env-var mistake could start
  orchestration or outbound alerts. Final synthetic staging validation requires
  those surfaces to stay off. Source PR #103 claimed AT-ADR-039; remapped to
  AT-ADR-040 so backend hardening keeps AT-ADR-039.
- **Decision:**
  1. `deployment_safety` rejects Watcher (scanner, bridge, auto-tick, orchestration)
     and Telegram (alerts, interaction, automatic delivery) when `ENVIRONMENT` is
     staging or production. The same checks are not duplicated: they sit next to
     the paper/`real_trading_enabled` pins.
  2. `/health` exposes those flags plus `exchange_mode` so `verify-safety.sh` can
     assert them without printing secrets.
  3. Real trading remains permanently impossible (`paper_safety`).
  4. Canonical HTTP minting is still out of scope; synthetic smoke seeds via
     existing services or optional operator IDs.
- **Alternatives considered:** Leave flags default-off only (rejected: operator
  misconfig could enable Watcher/Telegram on staging).
- **Safety impact:** Tightens paper staging; does not enable live trading.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_staging_readiness`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_deployment_safety.py` and
  `backend/tests/test_canonical_staging_smoke.py`. Integrated on
  `cursor/final_release_integration-c461`.

## AT-ADR-041 — Final paper-release candidate integration
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Status:** Accepted (integration; draft PR only; do not merge or deploy)
- **Context:** PR102, PR101, and PR103 landed independently on `main@c39dca6`.
  All three claimed AT-059. PR102 and PR103 both claimed AT-ADR-039.
  `deployment_safety` Watcher/Telegram locks overlapped.
- **Decision:**
  1. Integration order is PR102 → PR101 → PR103. Do not merge `main`. Do not deploy.
  2. Task/ADR IDs remap to AT-059/AT-ADR-039 (backend hardening), AT-060/AT-ADR-037
     (canonical UX), AT-061/AT-ADR-040 (staging readiness), AT-062/AT-ADR-041
     (this integration).
  3. Watcher/Telegram fail-closed checks are kept once beside paper and
     `real_trading_enabled` pins. `/health` posture flags from staging readiness
     remain the operator-visible surface.
  4. Canonical frontend binds GET APIs and `POST /execution/paper-plan` only.
     ProposalService tenant-scopes before `canonical_plan_root` rejection.
  5. Alembic remains a single head: `d4f7a2c8e901`.
  6. Paper only. Watcher and Telegram stay disabled. Kill switch and risk BLOCK
     stay final. Human approval is mandatory. No silent learning loss. Cross-tenant
     lookups fail closed. Duplicate/restart paper-plan requests are idempotent.
- **Alternatives considered:** Last-write-wins on `deployment_safety` (rejected:
  would drop either `real_trading_enabled` pin or `/health` operator surface);
  merge to `main` in this wave (rejected).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No deploy. No real exchange mutation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_release_integration-c461`. Draft PR
  https://github.com/Fejjii/AlphaTrade-AI/pull/104. GitHub CI run 35466201940
  success. Report `docs/FINAL_RELEASE_READINESS.md`.

## AT-ADR-042 — Canonical live read-only USD-M evidence pipeline (AT-064)
- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #110; remapped on intelligence integration)
- **Context:** Phase 5 USD-M contracts and CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1 existed, but
  canonical reads still lacked a live/read-only assembler. Compatibility
  `POST /market/analyze` snapshots could be presented as current market prices.
- **Decision:**
  1. Assemble first-slice evidence from existing Binance USD-M GET-only contracts
     into CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1. BTCUSDT is the enabled catalog default;
     additional USD-M symbols are registerable without rewriting the assembler.
  2. Current price is the last contracted perpetual trade in the 10s freshness
     window. Missing, stale, or incomplete evidence fails closed. No spot fallback.
     No fabricated prices. Replay fixtures are labeled `replay_fixture` and are
     never `usable_as_current_market_price`.
  3. Canonical identity remains the §26 window preimage. `organization_id` forks
     tenant hashes. Connection ids and receive times stay out of the window hash.
  4. Expose truthful current price + freshness on `GET /canonical/evidence`.
     Canonical UI (`/decision/market`) uses that GET path. Compatibility snapshots
     must not be shown as live marks.
  5. `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE` stays configurable; production/runtime default
     remains `replay`. Watcher is not activated. `AssemblingWatcherScanEvidence`
     is not wired into the worker.
  6. Paper only: `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`. No exchange
     mutation, Telegram, strategy redesign, or live trading.
- **Alternatives considered:** Reuse `POST /market/analyze` as canonical current
  price (rejected: frozen/mock snapshots); auto-enable Watcher when live source
  is selected (rejected: explicit non-goal); spot fallback on USD-M outage
  (rejected: AT-ADR-021).
- **Safety impact:** Tightens honesty of market marks; does not enable Watcher
  or live trading.
- **Consequences:** Source branch `cursor/live_evidence_pipeline-5b0d`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_live_evidence_pipeline.py`,
  `backend/tests/test_canonical_evidence_http.py`, and canonical frontend
  honesty tests. Draft source PR #110 — do not merge independently.

## AT-ADR-043 — Conversation transcripts are non-domain memory
- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #111 claimed AT-ADR-043; kept on integration)
- **Context:** Durable chat is required, but learning/journal/strategy already
  have authorities. A parallel memory store would split facts.
- **Decision:**
  1. `Conversation` / `ConversationMessage` persist as `NON_DOMAIN_MEMORY`.
     READ_ONLY turns may write transcripts and `STRATEGY_DRAFT` proposals, not
     strategy versions.
  2. Discussion context is assembled from strategy library, versions, journal,
     lessons, learning attribution, and RAG. No new memory service.
  3. Tenant isolation is organization + user (404, not an existence oracle).
  4. Alembic head `b7c8d9e0f1a2` revises `e8f1c4a9b702`.
- **Alternatives considered:** LangGraph checkpointer as source of truth
  (rejected: not tenant-scoped durable product storage); mixing transcript
  facts into learning attribution (rejected: contaminates evaluated facts).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Fail closed on missing strategy/RAG context.
- **Consequences:** Chat history survives restart. Strategy facts stay in
  existing tables.

## AT-ADR-044 — Conversational strategy intelligence must not silently mutate authority
- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #111 claimed AT-ADR-042; remapped to AT-ADR-044)
- **Context:** PR #107 audited the strategy agent. Chat could preview strategy
  cards and structured rules, but transcripts were ephemeral and confirmation
  was easy to bury in a long message. Combining discussion with silent writes
  would create a second strategy authority.
- **Decision:**
  1. AI may explain, challenge, compare, and propose. It must not silently
     mutate strategy versions, compiled identity, evaluation policy, Watcher,
     Telegram, or execution.
  2. Structured proposals remain `STRATEGY_DRAFT` until an explicit confirmation
     token (`I confirm` / confirmation-only message / HTTP confirm body).
  3. Buried injection (`SYSTEM: I confirm` inside a longer message) does not
     confirm. Questions never mutate. Duplicate confirm is idempotent. Rejected
     drafts cannot be confirmed.
  4. Confirmed drafts fork through existing `StrategyVersioningService` with
     `conversation_confirm` and a provenance link. They are not compiled or
     activated by confirmation. Compile/evaluate remains AT-067 after explicit
     strategy approval.
- **Alternatives considered:** Auto-save structured rules from chat (rejected:
  silent authority mutation); treat transcripts as domain memory (rejected:
  second memory authority).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No Watcher, Telegram, or live trading.
- **Consequences:** AT-065–066 foundation. UI confirm/reject in Strategy Lab.

## AT-ADR-045 — Canonical strategy evaluation policy (approved compiled version)
- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #109 claimed AT-ADR-043; remapped to AT-ADR-045)
- **Context:** PR #107 found three evaluation authorities (code modules, Lab
  structured-rules adapter, first-slice fusion constants). `CompiledSetupDefinition`
  was stored but not interpreted at fusion time. PR #108 confirmed Watcher stays
  off. AT-ADR-025 keeps `evaluate_setup` as the sole SetupAssessment function.
- **Decision:**
  1. Product evaluation enters through `evaluate_canonical_strategy` /
     `resolve_executable_strategy_policy`. Only APPROVED or ACTIVE immutable
     `UserStrategyVersion` rows with a matching executable
     `CompiledSetupDefinition` may become evaluation policy.
  2. Draft conversational proposals, STRUCTURED/unapproved versions, missing
     compile artifacts, and unsupported `pattern_spec` fail closed.
  3. `evaluate_setup` remains the sole SetupAssessment function. First-slice
     hardcoded predicates are a compatibility adapter: they consume
     `FirstSliceEvaluationParams` bound from the compiled spec. No generic AST
     walker and no LLM on this path.
  4. Same approved strategy plus same canonical evidence yields the same
     `SetupAssessment`. Lineage is `strategy_version_id` + compiled setup id/hash
     already hashed into `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1`.
  5. Watcher fusion evaluation calls this boundary (Watcher remains disabled).
     Paper validation exposes `evaluate_canonical_setup` on the same boundary.
     Candidate creation is unchanged. Read-projection placeholder IDs must never
     mint Candidates.
  6. Code modules `/strategies/evaluate` stay a separate Lab/chat tool, not
     SetupAssessment authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Walk a generic compiled AST now (rejected: first
  slice only; compiler already fail-closes unsupported kinds); require stored
  spec to match constants exactly and ignore compiled thresholds (rejected:
  silent dual policy); enable Watcher to “finish the loop” (rejected: AT-ADR-040).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No Watcher/Telegram/live-trading flag change.
  SetupAssessment remains independent of account/risk.
- **Consequences:** Docs `docs/AT067_canonical_strategy_evaluation_policy.md`.
  Tests `backend/tests/test_at067_canonical_strategy_evaluation_policy.py`.

## AT-ADR-046 — Intelligence integration of PR109, PR110, and PR111
- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Status:** Accepted (integration; draft PR only; do not merge or deploy)
- **Context:** Three draft PRs landed independently on `main@20d2cac`. PR #110
  and PR #111 both claimed AT-064 / AT-ADR-042. PR #109 and PR #111 both claimed
  AT-ADR-043. Required correctness gaps: evidence identity, Watcher
  `executable_policy`, freshness vs candle close, conversation-to-pattern
  preview, and confirmation safety.
- **Decision:**
  1. Integration order is PR #109 → PR #110 → PR #111. Do not merge `main`.
     Do not deploy. Do not push source branches.
  2. Task/ADR IDs remap to AT-064/AT-ADR-042 (evidence pipeline),
     AT-065/AT-ADR-043 (conversation transcripts), AT-066/AT-ADR-044
     (confirmation-gated drafts), AT-067/AT-ADR-045 (canonical evaluation
     policy), AT-063/AT-ADR-046 (this integration).
  3. Alembic remains a single head: `b7c8d9e0f1a2` revising `e8f1c4a9b702`
     (journal `account_id` from PR #106). Validate with PostgreSQL through
     Alembic, not only `create_all`.
  4. Paper only. Replay remains the deployment default. Watcher and Telegram
     stay disabled. No automatic strategy approval. No exchange mutation.
- **Alternatives considered:** Merge source PRs independently to main (rejected:
  overlapping API clients, governance IDs, and incomplete Watcher/evidence
  contracts); enable Watcher to prove the loop (rejected: AT-ADR-040).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No deploy. No real exchange mutation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/intelligence_integration-1ea1`. Draft
  integration PR only; stop for independent review.

## AT-ADR-047 — Durable setup lifetime and canonical paper-trade authority
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted (remediation; draft PR only; do not merge or deploy)
- **Context:** Final independent acceptance review left two P1s open. Setup
  lifetime pins lived in process memory, so restart reset the original trigger.
  Paper-validation `scan` used a boolean approved-lineage gate, then
  `PaperBotEngine` plus invented StructuredRules to mint AUTO_PAPER trades.
- **Decision:**
  1. Persist setup-lifetime identity in `setup_lifetime_pins` keyed by tenant,
     symbol, timeframe, strategy version, and compiled setup id/hash. Pins store
     original trigger interval end, trigger bar hash, expiry state, and a
     semantic lineage hash. Transport metadata is excluded. Duplicate writes
     converge. An expired pin cannot resurrect after restart.
  2. Automated paper minting consumes only persisted APPROVED/ACTIVE compiled
     policy → canonical evidence → `evaluate_canonical_strategy` →
     `CONFIRMED_SETUP`. `PaperBotEngine.evaluate_entry` is not an AUTO_PAPER
     authority. Draft, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, unsupported, incomplete, stale,
     expired, wrong-source, and mismatched-lineage inputs fail closed.
  3. `evaluate_setup` remains the sole SetupAssessment function.
     `CandidateLifecycleService` remains the sole Candidate authority.
     Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay disabled.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep in-memory pins and document restart
  (rejected: P1); invent a second paper SetupAssessment (rejected).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No Watcher/Telegram/live-trading flag change.
- **Consequences:** Alembic head `c8d9e0f1a2b3`. Draft PR only; no merge or
  deploy.

## AT-ADR-048 — Continuous live read-only USD-M market monitor (AT-069)
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #118; remapped on Watcher integration)
- **Context:** AT-064 assembles first-slice evidence on demand. Watcher still
  needs a continuous, honest perpetual feed. Compatibility `/market` snapshots
  and replay fixtures must never be shown as current live prices.
- **Decision:**
  1. Add `app.market_monitor` on existing Binance USD-M GET-only adapters and
     Phase 5 cursor/CVD/freshness contracts. BTCUSDT is the catalog default.
  2. Current price is the last contracted perpetual trade in the 10s window.
     Provider outage, symbol mismatch, conflicting duplicates, out-of-order
     trades, and unresolved gaps fail closed. No spot substitution.
  3. HTTP 429 is a distinct `RateLimitedError` with bounded Retry-After backoff.
     Reconnect starts a new connection epoch. Transport metadata (connection
     ids, receive times, backoff) is excluded from the semantic hash.
  4. Expose `GET /canonical/market-status` with availability
     `fresh|stale|degraded|unavailable|replay`. Replay remains the default
     source and is never `live_mark`.
  5. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay disabled by default. Source PR
     #118 left the monitor port unwired; AT-072 binds it as the Watcher
     current-quote/stream gate without a second evidence authority.
- **Alternatives considered:** Background websocket (rejected for this slice:
  reuse existing REST capabilities); treat 429 as regional outage (rejected:
  recoverable backoff); show last-good price during outage (rejected: fail closed).
- **Safety impact:** Tightens market-mark honesty. Does not enable Watcher or
  live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Source branch `cursor/live-market-monitoring-cc4d`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_live_market_monitor.py` and
  `backend/tests/test_live_market_monitor_http.py`. Draft source PR only.

## AT-ADR-049 — Paper-only continuous Watcher runtime (AT-070)
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #120 claimed AT-ADR-048 / AT-069; remapped)
- **Context:** Canonical Watcher evaluation, Postgres leases/fencing, live
  read-only evidence assembly, and CandidateLifecycleService already exist on
  main. The missing piece is a continuous paper worker that polls approved
  compiled strategies without enabling staging/production flags, Telegram, or
  live orders.
- **Decision:**
  1. Dedicated process `python -m app.workers.watcher_paper` is the canonical
     worker. The API may autostart a daemon thread only when
     `paper_runtime_enabled`: local + paper + `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`
     + real trading false. Staging/production still reject the flag.
  2. One scan unit is tenant x approved compiled version x symbol. BTCUSDT is
     always first. `resolve_executable_strategy_policy` is the only target
     filter. Drafts, other tenants, and missing compiles never become targets.
  3. Evidence comes from `AssemblingWatcherScanEvidence`. Stale data and
     provider outages fail closed (`stale_evidence` / `provider_outage`). No
     second evaluator: `WatcherFusionEvaluationService` →
     `evaluate_canonical_strategy` → `evaluate_setup`.
  4. Candidate persist requires `ExecutablePolicyAuthority.PERSISTED_APPROVED_COMPILED`
     and the Watcher evaluation clock bound to evidence time. Kill switch does
     not block monitoring or Candidate persist; it must not invoke execution or
     Telegram.
  5. Idempotency key is `watcher-paper:{policy_id}:{symbol}:{closed_15m_end}` so
     subsequent bars can re-evaluate expiry. `WatcherOrchestrator` leases remain
     the single-active-worker fence.
- **Alternatives considered:** Enable staging Watcher flags (rejected: explicit
  do-not); put DB model imports in `app.watcher` (rejected: foundation isolation);
  invent a second setup evaluator (rejected).
- **Safety impact:** Paper monitoring only. Defaults stay disabled. No Telegram,
  no live orders, no real exchange credentials.
- **Consequences:** Status at `GET /watcher/paper-runtime/status`. Prometheus
  counters on the existing registry. Draft source PR only; no merge or deploy.

## AT-ADR-050 — Watcher PAPER MONITORING is runtime evidence, not configuration
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted (source PR #119 claimed AT-ADR-048 / AT-069; remapped)
- **Context:** Operators needed a truthful Watcher paper-monitoring surface.
  Two stacks exist: the legacy market-watcher scanner/bridge (disabled by
  default) and unused Phase 7 orchestration leases/health. Frontend flags
  must not be treated as RUNNING. No market-data authority or strategy
  evaluation authority belongs in this slice.
- **Decision:**
  1. `GET /market-watcher/monitoring` is a read-only aggregation of existing
     stores. Operator state is `RUNNING` | `STOPPED` | `DEGRADED` | `STALE` |
     `BLOCKED`.
  2. `RUNNING` requires live runtime evidence: a fenced orchestration lease
     with a fresh heartbeat, or a live watcher-worker heartbeat with both
     scanner and worker flags enabled. Scanner-only flags remain `STOPPED`.
     Orchestration enabled without a heartbeat is `STALE`. Kill switch and
     non-paper/real-trading posture are `BLOCKED`. Provider outage overlays
     `DEGRADED` only when runtime evidence already exists.
  3. SetupAssessment shown on the card is lineage from persisted Candidates
     (`CONFIRMED_SETUP`). This slice does not call `evaluate_setup` or mint
     Candidates.
  4. Dashboard, Decision (Plan), Strategy Lab, `/watcher`, and
     `/market-watcher` reuse one monitoring card. No duplicate Watcher
     workflow and no Watcher/Telegram/live-trading enablement.
- **Alternatives considered:** Infer RUNNING from frontend config (rejected:
  fake activity); create a second evaluator for SetupAssessment (rejected:
  AT-ADR-045/047); activate Watcher to populate the card (rejected:
  AT-ADR-040).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Watcher and Telegram stay disabled. No
  trades. No live trading. No canonical evaluator change.
- **Consequences:** Source branch `cursor/watcher_monitoring_ux-c026`. Draft
  source PR only; no merge or deploy.

## AT-ADR-051 — Paper Watcher stack has one evidence authority and one evaluator
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PR #118 (live monitor), PR #120 (paper Watcher runtime), and
  PR #119 (monitoring UX) landed as independent slices on overlapping IDs.
  Integration must not merge those source PRs, must not deploy, and must not
  activate Watcher. Dual market fetches and config-as-RUNNING were the
  remaining honesty risks.
- **Decision:**
  1. The live/read-only monitor is the current-quote and trade-stream gate
     (`watcher_evidence_error_for_monitor`). `FirstSliceEvidenceAssembler`
     remains the sole `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1` producer. Shared source:
     replay monitor with replay assembler, live monitor with live assembler.
     Mode mismatch is `wrong_source`. Replay is allowed for deterministic
     tests and is never a live perpetual mark.
  2. Canonical authority is exactly: persisted APPROVED/ACTIVE strategy →
     executable compiled definition → gated canonical evidence →
     `evaluate_canonical_strategy` → SetupAssessment → `CONFIRMED_SETUP`
     only → Candidate. No second evaluator. In-memory policy authority
     cannot mint.
  3. Freshness clocks stay separate and fail closed: current quote, trade
     stream, closed-candle finality, historical evidence validity, setup
     lifetime. Existing safety thresholds are not weakened. No spot
     fallback. No fabricated prices. Provider outage and stale evidence
     refuse Candidate mint.
  4. Monitoring RUNNING requires fenced lease + fresh heartbeat. Paper poll
     is the next-scan basis when the paper worker is the live evidence.
     Configuration flags never project RUNNING. Replay/demo prices never
     appear as current live perpetual marks.
  5. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay off. Staging/production still
     reject Watcher activation flags. Dedicated activation remains a
     separate authorized task.
- **Alternatives considered:** Merge source PRs 118/119/120 (rejected:
  explicit do-not); dual assembler+monitor evidence windows (rejected: two
  authorities); treat config as RUNNING (rejected: AT-ADR-050); enable
  Watcher to populate monitoring (rejected: AT-ADR-040).
- **Safety impact:** Tightens fail-closed wiring. Does not enable Watcher,
  Telegram, or live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`,
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Integration branch `cursor/watcher_integration-b74b`.
  Draft integration PR only; no merge, deploy, or Watcher activation.

## AT-ADR-052 — Continuous paper evaluation is measurement, not a trading authority
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** After AT-072, Watcher, eligibility, paper execution, Journal, and
  learning attribution exist as separate authorities. Operators need a
  continuous paper evaluation layer (win rate, expectancy, drawdown, MFE/MAE,
  conversion, false signals, blocked trades, human vs system, missed
  opportunities, data quality, strategy-version comparison) without creating
  another setup/Candidate/execution writer.
- **Decision:**
  1. `app.paper_evaluation` copies facts from existing authorities and rolls
     them up at query time. It does not evaluate setups, mint Candidates,
     authorize plans, or dispatch execution.
  2. Deterministic facts and AI narrative are siblings. Narrative is excluded
     from `content_hash`. Missed opportunities never invent counterfactual PnL.
  3. AI may emit `RefinementSuggestion` with `activate=false` and
     `auto_activate=false`. Activation is always forbidden.
  4. Operator summary is `GET /canonical/paper-evaluation/summary`.
     `watcher_activated` and `live_executable` stay false. Watcher, Telegram,
     and live trading stay off.
- **Alternatives considered:** Auto-promote a better strategy version (rejected:
  AT-ADR-026 / learning is review-only); treat Watcher config as RUNNING to
  populate metrics (rejected: AT-ADR-050); invent counterfactual missed PnL
  (rejected: not a recorded fact).
- **Safety impact:** Measurement only. Does not enable Watcher, Telegram, or
  live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Alembic revision `e3f4a5b6c7d8` (parent of the Telegram
  identity revision). Draft PR only; no merge, deploy, or Watcher activation.

## AT-ADR-053 — Telegram paper interaction is discussion, never trading authority
- **Date:** 2026-09-21
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** After AT-072 the paper Watcher can persist CONFIRMED_SETUP
  Candidates, but operators still cannot discuss those events in Telegram
  without a paper-only interaction layer. Telegram security, Candidate alerts,
  and conversation foundations already exist and must be reused. A Telegram
  message must never become trading authority.
- **Decision:**
  1. `app.telegram_paper_agent` composes `TelegramSecurityProtocol` and
     `CandidateAlertGateway`. Watcher `PERSIST_AND_NOTIFY` stays
     `notify_disabled`. The paper worker may take an optional scan hook;
     default is no hook and no Telegram send.
  2. Meaningful alerts are CONFIRMED_SETUP with a persisted Candidate and
     fail-closed blocked scans (`stale_evidence`, `provider_outage`,
     `wrong_source`, `candidate_creation_failed`). Empty successful scans are
     not alerts. Journal outcomes use the same durable identity/outbox path.
  3. Inbound private-chat messages are authorized by
     `receive_private_message`. Discussion is read-only unless an exact issued
     nonce payload is presented. Bare `I confirm` is not mutation authority
     when multiple actions were presented.
  4. Telegram refuses: implicit strategy approval/compile/activate, SetupAssessment
     override, risk override, Candidate mint, live or paper order placement,
     live-trading enablement, `CLOSE`, `EXECUTE_PAPER_PLAN`. `APPROVE` remains
     protocol `AuthorizationIntent` only (`executes=false`).
  5. Dedup uses deterministic identity hashes and existing outbox idempotency
     (`paper-notify:`, `paper-thread:`, `candidate-alert:`). Delivery, retry,
     rate limits, and audit stay on the Telegram security store. Paper identity
     recovers from `telegram_paper_*` (Alembic `d9e0f1a2b3c4`).
  6. `TELEGRAM_INTERACTION_ENABLED` defaults false. Staging/production still
     reject the flag. No FastAPI webhook. No deploy. No merge.
- **Alternatives considered:** Enable Watcher `PERSIST_AND_NOTIFY` (rejected:
  AT-040/051; notify remains blocked); mount a Telegram webhook (rejected:
  HTTP adapter is a later slice); treat chat text as strategy or risk
  authority (rejected: Telegram is never trading authority).
- **Safety impact:** Paper discussion only. Does not enable Telegram, Watcher,
  or live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Alembic revision `d9e0f1a2b3c4` revises `e3f4a5b6c7d8`.
  Source PR #124 claimed AT-073 / AT-ADR-052; remapped because AT-073 is
  continuous paper evaluation. Branch `cursor/telegram_paper_agent-aac1`.
  Draft PR only; no merge, deploy, or Telegram activation.

## AT-ADR-054 — Evaluation and Telegram share one paper chain and no trading authority
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PR #122 (continuous paper evaluation) and PR #124 (Telegram paper
  interaction) both sit on PR #121 and both claimed AT-073 / AT-ADR-052. Their
  Alembic revisions both revise `c8d9e0f1a2b3`. Operators need one linear
  schema and one path from a Watcher scan to measurement and to discussion.
- **Decision:**
  1. AT-073 / AT-ADR-052 remain continuous paper evaluation. Telegram paper
     interaction is AT-074 / AT-ADR-053. This integration is AT-075 / AT-ADR-054.
  2. Alembic is one chain: `c8d9e0f1a2b3` → `e3f4a5b6c7d8` (paper evaluation
     observations) → `d9e0f1a2b3c4` (paper Telegram identity).
  3. `WatcherPaperRuntime` records evaluation through the existing observer and
     then calls an optional scan hook. `build_paper_runtime` leaves that hook
     unset. `telegram_scan_hook` is the only composer from a scan report to
     `TelegramPaperAgent.project_watcher_notice`.
  4. Confirmed-setup discussion uses the evaluator's `WatcherDiscussionSnapshot`
     (the Candidate, SetupAssessment, and evidence window just persisted). It
     does not re-evaluate setup truth.
  5. `EvaluationLearningContext` reads `PaperEvaluationQueryService` and copies
     deterministic fact lines only. Narrative is excluded. Refinement lines
     keep `activate=false` and `auto_activate=false`.
  6. Telegram still cannot place orders, mint Candidates, override
     SetupAssessment or risk, approve or activate a strategy, or enable live
     trading. Evaluation still cannot activate a refinement. Risk BLOCK stays
     final. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading stay disabled.
- **Alternatives considered:** Two Alembic heads (rejected: deploy cannot pick
  one); install the Telegram hook inside `build_paper_runtime` (rejected:
  Telegram stays off and a recipient binding is not configuration); let
  Telegram text rewrite evaluation hashes (rejected: facts and narrative stay
  siblings).
- **Safety impact:** Measurement and discussion only. Does not enable Watcher,
  Telegram, or live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Draft integration PR only. Do not merge, deploy, or
  activate Watcher or Telegram.

## AT-ADR-055 — Final paper system keeps one authority per decision
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PR #126 remediates Watcher freshness, product proof, unique
  worker identity, fencing, and live/replay mismatch on top of AT-072. PR #125
  adds paper evaluation and Telegram discussion on the pre-remediation Watcher.
  The final paper loop must use the remediated Watcher as the scan authority
  and attach evaluation and Telegram as advisory layers. Source PRs stay
  unmerged. Watcher and Telegram stay off. Live trading stays off.
- **Decision:**
  1. This composition is AT-076 / AT-ADR-055. Base is PR #126
     `75bee6d74c71edb39a73a5965784b6d388b7772d`. PR #125
     `189d9752ec3daaa512fbde42127ed321f11f5f61` is applied semantically. Neither
     source PR is merged.
  2. One market-evidence authority: the live monitor gates current quote and
     trade-stream freshness; `FirstSliceEvidenceAssembler` is the only
     `CanonicalEvidenceWindowV1` producer. PR #126 freshness contracts remain
     authoritative. Missing monitor is `missing_monitor`. Live/replay mismatch
     is `wrong_source`. Stale evidence and provider outage still fail closed
     before assembly.
  3. One strategy authority: persisted approved compiled policy
     (`ExecutablePolicyAuthority.PERSISTED_APPROVED_COMPILED`). In-memory
     policy cannot mint a Candidate.
  4. One SetupAssessment authority: `evaluate_canonical_strategy`. One
     Candidate authority: `CandidateLifecycleService`, and only on a genuine
     `CONFIRMED_SETUP`. Unique worker instance ids stay intact. The same owner
     cannot renew a lease without the current fencing token. The worker clock
     and the candidate-repository fence clock are the same clock passed to
     `build_production_canonical_runtime`.
  5. One automated paper-decision authority: ActionEligibility, then
     `CanonicalTradePlanService`, then paper execution, Journal, and
     attribution. Risk `BLOCK` is final. `paper_evaluation` reads deterministic
     facts only. AI refinement stays a suggestion (`activate=false`,
     `auto_activate=false`) and `refuse_activation` rejects activation.
  6. Telegram is an advisory interaction layer. `main()` does not install
     `telegram_scan_hook`. Telegram cannot mint a Candidate, override
     SetupAssessment, override risk, activate a strategy, place an order, or
     enable live trading. Learning discussion may load eligibility so the
     Telegram fact hash matches the canonical summary. Default loader is none.
  7. Alembic stays one chain: `c8d9e0f1a2b3` → `e3f4a5b6c7d8` →
     `d9e0f1a2b3c4`. No new revision.
  8. Watcher, Telegram, and live trading remain disabled. No exchange
     mutation, no real credentials, no deployment.
- **Alternatives considered:** Merge PR #125 and PR #126 (rejected: explicit
  do-not); let Telegram or evaluation write Candidates or strategy state
  (rejected: two authorities); weaken `wrong_source` into `stale_evidence`
  (rejected: PR #126 source gate stays authoritative); share a wall clock for
  the fence while the worker uses evidence time (rejected: the lease expires
  before Candidate persist).
- **Safety impact:** Composition only. Does not enable Watcher, Telegram, or
  live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_paper_system_integration`. Draft PR
  only. Do not merge, deploy, or activate Watcher or Telegram.

## AT-ADR-056 — Staging USD-M evidence is public read-only, rollback is replay
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The Binance USD-M public adapter, 10-second freshness rule, and
  canonical trade/CVD/OHLCV/coverage contracts already exist. Staging still
  intends `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE=replay`, so operators have no controlled
  path to real read-only market evidence.
- **Decision:**
  1. The process default stays `replay` for local, CI, production, and
     rollback. Staging's intended source is `binance_usdm` on
     `https://fapi.binance.com`, declared in `.env.staging.example` and
     `render.yaml`. Applying it is a human environment change. This task does
     not edit a live platform environment and does not deploy.
  2. Selecting `binance_usdm` fails closed unless the profile holds: public
     USD-M origin only, no Binance or BloFin credentials, `exchange_mode`
     `paper_internal`, Watcher and Telegram flags false, paper execution, and
     not production. Spot, Coin-M, and plain HTTP are rejected. No fabricated
     fallback. BTCUSDT stays the default catalog symbol. Live quote freshness
     stays 10 seconds.
  3. `GET /health` and `GET /canonical/market-status` report the configured
     source, activation (`inactive` replay or `active` live), freshness, and
     that credentials and spot fallback are not used. Replay prices stay
     `replay_fixture`.
  4. Rollback is `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE=replay` plus a restart.
     `scripts/validate-live-market-staging.sh` checks the profile offline and
     the running health payload. It does not write environment variables.
- **Alternatives considered:** Flip the code default to live (rejected: CI and
  deterministic tests would need the network); allow production to select the
  live source in the same change (rejected: activation is staging-only);
  keep a last price during outage (rejected: fail closed).
- **Safety impact:** Read-only public market data when a human applies the
  staging env change. Does not enable Watcher, Telegram, or live trading.
  `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/activation_live_market`. Draft PR only.
  Do not merge, deploy, or activate Watcher or Telegram. Operators follow
  `docs/live_market_staging_activation.md`.

## AT-ADR-057 — Staging Watcher paper activation is a disarmed, fail-closed arm
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The validated Watcher can scan locally in paper mode. Staging
  and production reject `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`. A controlled staging
  path is required for paper monitoring only, without Telegram, without live
  trading, and without turning the worker on in this change.
- **Decision:**
  1. `WATCHER_PAPER_STAGING_ACTIVATION` defaults false. Production rejects it.
     Staging rejects `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED` unless this arm is set.
     The armed pair still requires live perpetual evidence. Replay, Telegram,
     the legacy scanner, and real trading still fail settings load.
  2. The API process does not autostart staging. Only
     `python -m app.workers.watcher_paper` calls preflight, and it scans only
     when every pin holds: unique worker id, PostgreSQL leases, fencing,
     restart recovery, idempotency, approved compiled lineage, canonical live
     evidence, freshness fail-closed, `CONFIRMED_SETUP` as the only Candidate
     authority, risk `BLOCK` final, paper execution, and the kill switch.
  3. The runtime health gate repeats those pins each cycle and stops the
     process on failure. Rollback prints an operator plan and does not deploy,
     edit environment files, clear the kill switch, or enable Telegram.
  4. This decision does not arm staging and does not modify staging environment
     values. Templates keep Watcher and Telegram false.
- **Alternatives considered:** Flip `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED` in
  `render.yaml` (rejected: that is activation); allow replay evidence on the
  arm (rejected: live canonical evidence is required); autostart inside the
  API (rejected: the dedicated worker is the only start path).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays permanently
  rejected. Default staging posture is unchanged until a human sets the arm.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/activation-watcher-paper-5263`. Do not
  deploy or activate from this change. Source PR #130 recorded this decision as
  AT-ADR-056 before the live-market decision took that id. The accepted id
  on the integration branch is AT-ADR-057.

## AT-ADR-058 — Paper Telegram activation is armed only by an explicit local preflight
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-074 and AT-076 can project a Watcher or Candidate event into
  the Telegram outbox and discuss it, but the production-shaped intake,
  backoff, health, and rollback path was still absent. Operators need that
  path before any controlled activation. Watcher and live trading stay off.
  Staging environment variables stay unchanged.
- **Decision:**
  1. `app.telegram_activation` is the only paper activation controller.
     `TelegramPaperActivation.arm` fails closed unless preflight passes.
     Default settings are not armable. `create_app` does not mount a webhook
     and does not start polling.
  2. Inbound mode is `off`, `polling`, or `webhook`, never both. Webhook
     requests must present `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`. Polling uses an
     injected update source. HTTP clients refuse unless
     `TELEGRAM_NETWORK_PERMITTED=true`.
  3. Recipient binding, tenant isolation, outbox idempotency, send-ledger
     dedupe, retry backoff, expired-lease recovery, inbound and outbound rate
     limits, audit events, and delivery status stay on the existing security
     protocol plus the activation cursor and ledger.
  4. Paper mutations still require an explicit confirmation identity.
     Telegram cannot mint a Candidate, override SetupAssessment, override
     risk, activate a strategy, place an order, or enable live trading.
  5. Staging and production reject `TELEGRAM_PAPER_ACTIVATION_ARMED`,
     non-off `TELEGRAM_INBOUND_MODE`, `TELEGRAM_NETWORK_PERMITTED`, and a
     non-empty webhook secret. `render.yaml` is not modified.
  6. Rollback is a printed human checklist. The rollback command refuses
     `--apply` and does not edit environment files or deploy.
- **Alternatives considered:** Mount the webhook from `create_app` (rejected:
  activation must be explicit); enable Watcher `PERSIST_AND_NOTIFY` (rejected:
  notify stays blocked); send a real Telegram message during implementation
  (rejected: no test recipient was authorized for live delivery).
- **Safety impact:** Machinery only. Does not enable Watcher, Telegram, or
  live trading. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`.
- **Consequences:** Alembic `e0f1a2b3c4d5` revises `d9e0f1a2b3c4`. Branch
  `cursor/activation_telegram_paper-a361`. Draft PR only. Do not deploy or
  activate. Source PR #129 recorded this decision as AT-ADR-056. The
  integration branch assigns AT-ADR-058.
  AT-ADR-059 narrows staging rejection to incomplete arming flags. The
  historical source-PR validation claims are unchanged.

## AT-ADR-059 — One controlled paper activation package
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PR #128 (live USD-M evidence), PR #129 (Telegram paper
  activation), and PR #130 (Watcher paper activation) were each validated
  separately. Their settings disagree: live evidence refused Watcher and
  Telegram, Watcher required live evidence with Telegram off, and Telegram
  preflight refused every non-local environment. Staging needs one package
  that can be armed in a fixed order and rolled back without deleting rows.
- **Decision:**
  1. Production still refuses `binance_usdm`, the Watcher arm, and every
     Telegram arming flag. Defaults stay disarmed. Replay remains the
     rollback and test source.
  2. Staging may select public `binance_usdm` evidence alone. The Watcher
     pair (`WATCHER_PAPER_STAGING_ACTIVATION` and
     `WATCHER_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`) may be set only with that live source,
     paper execution, `paper_internal`, and legacy scanner flags off.
  3. Staging may arm Telegram only as the full projection: the Watcher pair,
     `binance_usdm`, `TELEGRAM_PAPER_ACTIVATION_ARMED`,
     `TELEGRAM_INTERACTION_ENABLED`, inbound polling with an empty webhook
     secret or webhook with a secret of at least 32 characters, and non-empty
     `TELEGRAM_BOT_ID` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Alerts and automatic delivery
     stay false. `TELEGRAM_NETWORK_PERMITTED` is allowed only with that
     package. A partial flag is still rejected.
  4. The dedicated Watcher process installs the projection hook only when
     that package is on and a verified private binding exists. A missing
     binding refuses the start. The API does not autostart the worker.
  5. Telegram still cannot mint a Candidate, override SetupAssessment,
     override risk, activate a strategy, place an order, or enable live
     trading. Risk `BLOCK` and the kill switch stay final.
  6. Rollback is one printed checklist. It returns to paper execution, replay
     evidence, and no automated monitoring. It does not delete database rows,
     downgrade Alembic, edit env, or deploy. `--apply` exits 2.
  7. Alembic stays a single head: `e0f1a2b3c4d5` revises `d9e0f1a2b3c4`.
  8. `render.yaml` keeps the step-3 evidence blueprint and does not arm
     Watcher or Telegram. This decision does not deploy and does not change
     the live staging environment.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep Telegram local-only (rejected: the
  package must project scans on staging); allow interaction without the
  Watcher arm (rejected: Telegram must not become a second scan authority);
  delete rows on rollback (rejected: audit and journal history stay).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`. `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING`
  stays false. No exchange credentials. No exchange mutation.
- **Consequences:** Operator procedure is `docs/controlled_paper_activation.md`.
  Branch `cursor/controlled_paper_activation_integration`. Do not merge and
  do not deploy from this change.

## AT-ADR-060 — Frontier paper runtime remediation
- **Date:** 2026-09-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The Frontier AT-080 audit on `070169c` found the paper package
  could not run a production-shaped Telegram process, could leak a bot token
  through HTTP client logs, and could repeat the same Binance aggTrade window.
  Staging also lacked a disarmed Watcher service, a single activation order,
  a kill-switch contract that matches Candidate and Telegram behavior, and
  health that reports the worker rather than only API flags.
- **Decision:**
  1. A dedicated process, `python -m app.telegram_activation run`, drains the
     durable outbox and polls. The Watcher only enqueues. Staging inbound is
     polling. Webhook remains for local tests and is not a staging activation
     path. `create_app` does not mount a webhook.
  2. Enrollment is `POST /telegram-paper/enrollment/start` plus a private-chat
     poll. The one-time token is not logged. The polling cursor is durable and
     does not move to another tenant. Restart resumes from the outbox and
     cursor. A Postgres runtime lease stops a second replica from sending.
  3. httpx and httpcore stay at WARNING. A stdlib redaction filter and
     formatter, plus the existing structlog processor, redact Telegram bot
     tokens in log lines, exception text, and trace-bound events. Application
     log level is unchanged.
  4. One closed aggTrade window is reused for evaluate and Candidate
     persistence. Public Binance reads use request weight, a sliding budget,
     Retry-After, bounded backoff, and process-local metrics. 418 and 451 are
     not retried. The Watcher lease TTL for `binance_usdm` is at least
     `timeout * 4 + max_backoff + 15` seconds, capped at 3600, and the lease
     heartbeats during a long read.
  5. `render.yaml` adds disarmed `alphatrade-watcher-paper-staging` and
     `alphatrade-telegram-paper-staging`. Flags stay false. No bot token is
     in the blueprint. This does not deploy.
  6. Armed Telegram projection requires polling, network permission, and a bot
     token together. Enrollment is the prior step and does not arm projection.
     An intermediate armed projection with network off fails Settings
     validation. A refused Watcher gate idles and heartbeats. It does not exit.
  7. For controlled automated paper operation the kill switch stops new
     Candidate mints, Watcher-started paper workflows, new Telegram enqueues,
     and delivery of queued automated messages. Monitoring continues.
     An unreadable switch is active. Rollback does not clear it.
  8. `GET /health` includes `worker_runtime` from `controlled_runtime_status`.
     A failed status read leaves liveness HTTP 200 with `available=false`.
  9. Alembic head `f1a2b3c4d5e6` revises `e0f1a2b3c4d5`. Live trading stays
     impossible.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep delivery inside the Watcher (rejected:
  the Watcher would become the Telegram authority); use webhook on staging
  (rejected: the API does not mount it); cache evidence across tenants
  (rejected: the snapshot cache key includes organization id).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`. `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING`
  stays false. `EXCHANGE_MODE` stays non-live. Telegram stays advisory.
- **Consequences:** Operator procedure remains
  `docs/controlled_paper_activation.md`. Branch
  `cursor/activation_frontier_remediation`. Do not merge, deploy, or activate.

## AT-ADR-061 — Shared Binance evidence, disarmed worker boot, heartbeat health
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The independent review of PR #132 left three findings open.
  Canonical API reads built a new aggTrade cache and request-weight budget
  per HTTP request. Dedicated staging workers in `render.yaml` did not carry
  the Settings contract required to boot. Worker health treated a persisted
  runtime row as live without considering heartbeat age.
- **Decision:**
  1. Canonical API evidence reads use one process pool per Binance
     configuration: one bounded closed-window aggTrade cache and one sliding
     request-weight budget. The cache key is retrieval policy, symbol, and
     the UTC window. It does not include a tenant. Same-key fetches
     single-flight. A different semantic fingerprint replaces the rows and
     counts as a correction. Age equal to the TTL is still fresh. Age past
     the TTL is a miss and is not served. Failures are not cached, and an
     idle lock from a failed fetch is released. A process restart drops the
     pool. The default `resolve_perpetual_evidence_source` stays isolated;
     sharing is opt-in for the API process.
  2. While a market-request progress hook is bound, a slow GET pulses that
     hook during the HTTP call, including a successful call, a 429, and a
     network timeout. The hook is captured on the caller thread. Backoff
     still uses the existing progress sleep. A Watcher lease can be renewed
     only while its fence is still active.
  3. `alphatrade-watcher-paper-staging` and
     `alphatrade-telegram-paper-staging` include the staging cookie, CORS,
     denylist, rate-limit, and trusted-proxy settings. `TELEGRAM_INBOUND_MODE`
     is the quoted string `off`. Secrets stay `sync: false`. Both workers
     stay disarmed. This blueprint change does not deploy.
  4. Worker component health is `RUNNING` only when the heartbeat age is
     within `watcher_heartbeat_stale_after_seconds` (default 90, inclusive).
     A missing heartbeat is `UNAVAILABLE`. A future, naive, or older
     heartbeat is `STALE`. `available` on the component is true only for
     `RUNNING`. A persisted activation state of `running` is not reported as
     running when the heartbeat is not fresh. The parent
     `worker_runtime.available` flag still means the status read succeeded.
     Post-activation smoke checks `health_state`, age, and the threshold.
  5. No Alembic revision. Head remains `f1a2b3c4d5e6`. Live trading stays
     impossible.
- **Alternatives considered:** Share the cache by default for every
  `resolve_perpetual_evidence_source` call (rejected: existing isolated
  reads and tests must stay isolated); treat any persisted row as RUNNING
  (rejected: that was the finding).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. `EXCHANGE_MODE` stays `paper_internal`
  in the worker blueprint. Neither worker is armed.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_three_activation_fixes`. Do not

## AT-ADR-062 — Disarmed Render workers boot before operational secrets
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AT-082 put the staging Settings contract on
  `alphatrade-watcher-paper-staging` and `alphatrade-telegram-paper-staging`,
  but Settings still required PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, OpenAI, and Qdrant
  before a disarmed worker could start. Those values are `sync: false` in
  `render.yaml`. Injecting placeholders would be a fake secret. Skipping the
  same checks for every staging process would weaken the API.
- **Decision:**
  1. Watcher and Telegram process startup read the disarmed paper posture
     before Settings applies operational-dependency checks. The role is
     process-local. It is not an environment variable.
  2. While that role is bound and the constructed settings are staging,
     paper, `paper_internal`, with Watcher and Telegram arms off and no bot
     token, Settings may be built without `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`,
     `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `QDRANT_URL`. The process then idles
     `disarmed` and does not open those dependencies.
  3. Cookie, CORS, denylist, rate-limit, trusted-proxy, paper-only, and
     `provider_mode!=mock` checks still run. JWT minimum length still runs.
     A short secret is rejected. The API calls `Settings()` with no worker
     role, so a literal API blueprint without secrets still fails.
  4. If either worker is armed, the role is not bound. Missing PostgreSQL,
     Redis, JWT, provider dependencies, or—for Telegram—the bot token still
     fail closed. Real trading stays impossible.
- **Alternatives considered:** Put placeholder secrets in `render.yaml`
  (rejected: fake credentials). Relax `validate_deployment_settings` for
  every disarmed staging process (rejected: the API blueprint is also
  disarmed and must keep failing closed).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. Neither blueprint worker is armed.
  No deploy and no activation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/final_render_worker_boot_fix`, based on
  `5ff0eb8c4a7d171118dfde921259a6da13b60abb`. Do not merge, deploy, or
  activate.

## AT-ADR-063 — Staging Blueprint omits the Slice 59 worker
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The paper runtime is the Vercel frontend plus three Render
  processes: `alphatrade-api-staging`, `alphatrade-watcher-paper-staging`,
  and `alphatrade-telegram-paper-staging`. `render.yaml` also defined
  `alphatrade-worker-staging` (`python -m app.workers.entrypoint`).
- **Decision:** Remove `alphatrade-worker-staging` from `render.yaml`. The
  application module stays. Nothing in the paper runtime starts that Render
  service.
  1. `app.workers.entrypoint` scans with the legacy setup detector, records
     `SetupDetectionRecord`, drains one queued backtest, and emits
     `WorkerNotifier` alerts. It does not start Watcher or Telegram.
  2. The paper scan authority is `python -m app.workers.watcher_paper`.
     It evaluates the approved compiled strategy and can mint a Candidate.
     Its evaluation observer records paper-evaluation facts. Legacy
     `MARKET_WATCHER_*` flags stay false.
  3. The paper Telegram authority is `python -m app.telegram_activation run`.
     It drains the outbox and polls. It does not mint Candidates.
  4. Paper execution, Journal projection, and learning attribution run
     through `ExecutionService` / `CanonicalPaperExecutionService` and
     `JournalLifecycleProjector`. The Slice 59 entrypoint does not call
     them. Watcher orchestration ports do not invoke execution or journal.
  5. `ENABLE_PAPER_SCHEDULER` stays false. The paper scheduler has no
     background loop. The Slice 59 entrypoint does not tick it.
  6. With `WORKER_ENABLED` false, queued backtests drain in the API via
     FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`. The API blueprint does not enable the worker.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep the disarmed Slice 59 service in the
  Blueprint (rejected: it has no unique paper-runtime responsibility and
  adds a paid worker). Delete `app.workers.entrypoint` (rejected: this
  change is the Blueprint only).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. Watcher and Telegram stay disarmed.
  No secrets are added. No deploy and no activation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/render_blueprint_final_cleanup`, based on
  `6314a2021441384b9a1bb20f6c0b82916b15f6bd`. Do not deploy or activate.

## AT-ADR-064 — One supervised paper worker
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The staging blueprint ran Watcher and Telegram as two Render
  workers plus the API. The paper path needs both runtimes, and a third
  compute service is not required for that split.
- **Decision:**
  1. `render.yaml` defines exactly `alphatrade-api-staging` and
     `alphatrade-paper-worker-staging`. Both stay on the Starter plan. The
     paper worker command is `python -m app.workers.paper_worker`. The
     dedicated Watcher service, the dedicated Telegram service, and the
     Slice 59 worker are not Blueprint services.
  2. The paper worker supervises the existing Watcher runtime and the
     existing Telegram runtime. Each has its own thread, health record, and
     failure counter. Settings objects are copied before either runtime is
     built. A Telegram exception does not rewrite Watcher health. A Watcher
     exception or authority-flag change is reverted on that copy and does
     not change the Telegram copy.
  3. Scan leases and the Telegram runtime lease, cursor, and outbox stay in
     the existing runtimes. The supervisor starts one loop of each. It does
     not call `app.workers.entrypoint` and it does not mount the API.
  4. Disarmed boot uses `WorkerBootRole.PAPER_WORKER` and does not open
     PostgreSQL, Redis, or a bot token. Armed boot does not bind that role,
     so the existing dependency and secret checks stay mandatory.
  5. No deploy and no activation. Live trading stays impossible.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep two worker services (rejected: the cost
  target is two Render compute services). Fold the worker into the API
  (rejected: a worker failure must not take down the API, and the API must
  not gain the worker's process role). Run the two runtimes as subprocesses
  of the supervisor (rejected: health and shutdown stay simpler in one
  process when each runtime already fences itself in PostgreSQL).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. The blueprint worker stays disarmed.
  Render's published Starter price is $7 per month for a web service and $7
  per month for a background worker (512 MB, 0.5 CPU), so the two compute
  services are $14 per month before workspace, PostgreSQL, Redis, and
  bandwidth. Those other charges are not set by this blueprint.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/consolidated-paper-worker-37fe`, based on
  `8a2512c85d8c876576410e9de300310f720b37cb`. Do not deploy or activate.

## AT-ADR-065 — Stored BloFin secrets stay sealed in paper isolation
- **Date:** 2026-09-24
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Staging Settings validation rejected
  `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE=binance_usdm` whenever `BLOFIN_API_KEY`,
  `BLOFIN_API_SECRET`, and `BLOFIN_API_PASSPHRASE` were present, even with
  `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`,
  `EXCHANGE_MODE=paper_internal`, and `BLOFIN_DEMO_ENABLED=false`.
- **Decision:** Credential storage, loading, client construction, and
  execution authorization are separate. Stored BloFin secrets may remain
  while paper isolation is active. They are not loaded into an authenticated
  client, are not sent on Binance USD-M evidence requests, and cannot place,
  cancel, or modify positions. The loader opens only for the complete demo
  execution gate (paper execution, real trading off, `paper_exchange_demo`,
  demo enabled, all three secrets, allowlisted demo host, and evidence that
  is not Binance USD-M). Any incomplete gate fails closed. Binance public
  evidence still refuses Binance credentials. Real trading stays disabled.
- **Alternatives considered:** Delete the credential-presence check only
  (rejected: presence would still be treated as access). Wipe Render secrets
  (rejected: storage is not execution authority).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No deploy. No live trading. No BloFin demo
  activation.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/execution-credentials-isolation-1e5a`.
  Tests in `backend/tests/test_execution_credential_isolation.py`.

## AT-ADR-066 — Binance HTTP 418 is a temporary ban, not a dead monitor
- **Date:** 2026-09-24
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** From Render Frankfurt, `fapi.binance.com` intermittently returns
  HTTP 418. The read-only client treated 418 like 401/403/451
  (`RegionalProviderFailureError`) and did not retry. A failed or incomplete
  reconnect backfill then set `GapState.UNRECOVERABLE`, and
  `SymbolMonitorRuntime` refused every later fetch until process restart.
- **Decision:**
  1. HTTP 418 is `UpstreamBanError`, a temporary IP ban. Retry only when
     another attempt remains and Retry-After fits `max_backoff_seconds`.
     A longer Retry-After is not followed by another request. The monitor
     waits out Retry-After up to Binance's 3-day ban ceiling. HTTP 401, 403,
     and 451 stay regional failures with no retry. HTTP 429 stays
     `RateLimitedError`. There is no spot or fabricated fallback.
  2. An empty or incomplete backfill stays on the same cursor and connection
     epoch, records the gap, and does not publish a usable price. A later
     attempt runs only after backoff. A complete backfill can recover without
     a process restart. A process restart still opens a new epoch.
  3. No deploy. Watcher and Telegram stay disarmed. Live trading stays off.
     No Alembic revision.
- **Alternatives considered:** Retry 418 on the same schedule as 429 even when
  Retry-After exceeds the cap (rejected: that sends another request during
  the ban). Keep the unrecoverable latch and rely on process restart
  (rejected: one empty backfill then kills the monitor for the life of the
  process).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. Evidence stays fail-closed while
  coverage is incomplete.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/binance-418-recovery-11ce`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_binance_usdm_staging_reliability.py`. Do not deploy
  or activate.

## AT-ADR-067 — Telegram paper discussion reads durable facts
- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The staging paper worker can enroll, poll, and deliver, but the
  armed projection built an empty in-memory discussion context. Journal and
  learning replies could not see recorded paper facts. Inbound discussion also
  ignored the latest stored Candidate unless the caller passed an assessment.
- **Decision:**
  1. The controlled projection uses PostgreSQL journal, paper-position, and
     strategy reads, plus paper-evaluation facts for learning text. It does
     not invent a SetupAssessment or evidence window.
  2. Inbound discussion may attach the latest stored Candidate for that
     organization. Without an assessment body, the reply cites stored
     Candidate facts only.
  3. A numeric `TELEGRAM_BOT_ID` must match the bot user id prefix of
     `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. A mismatch fails closed and is not logged with
     the token. Opaque non-numeric ids stay valid for tests.
  4. Staging activation is the combined paper worker after Watcher health is
     fresh. Do not run a second Telegram process. Do not deploy or arm from
     this change. `render.yaml` stays disarmed.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep the empty in-memory context and require
  operators to patch it (rejected: journal and learning replies would stay
  empty). Reconstruct SetupAssessment from Candidate hashes (rejected: that
  invents setup truth).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Telegram still cannot place an order, mint a
  Candidate, override risk, or enable live trading.
- **Consequences:** Operator steps are in `docs/telegram_paper_mvp_activation.md`.
  Do not deploy or activate.

## AT-ADR-068 — Bybit USDT perpetual is the explicit secondary evidence source
- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Render Frankfurt is HTTP 418 banned by Binance USD-M, so paper
  staging cannot depend only on `fapi.binance.com`. The canonical contract
  still needs perpetual price, trades, OHLCV, volume, taker-side CVD, freshness,
  and gap detection, each with its own provenance. An earlier draft of this
  change used OKX; that source is not the MVP secondary.
- **Decision:**
  1. Primary stays `binance_usdm`. Optional secondary is `bybit_usdt_perpetual`
     (public linear `BTCUSDT` only, base-coin size, taker side). Selecting
     `bybit_usdt_perpetual` as the primary is also legal. Replay stays the
     default and the rollback. Spot, inverse, and fabricated rows stay rejected.
  2. A primary 418, 429, or regional failure switches the whole active
     instrument and opens a new connection epoch. The failed primary payload
     is not published. Recovery returns to Binance only after its status is
     healthy, again on a new epoch. The two venues are never merged into one
     CVD window.
  3. Bybit public recent trades that do not reach the requested start fail
     closed. `seq` is a cross sequence and is not used as a per-trade id.
     A later read on the same connection that drops the last proven print
     fails closed. No missing prints are invented. Staging blueprint sets the
     secondary and does not arm Watcher, Telegram, or real trading. This
     decision does not deploy.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep OKX as the secondary (rejected: the
  required secondary is Bybit). Relabel Bybit prints as Binance (rejected:
  incompatible books). Use spot tickers (rejected).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. `EXECUTION_MODE=paper`.
  `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING` stays false. Binance GET allowlist is unchanged.
- **Consequences:** Branch `cursor/okx-perp-evidence-failover-98bd`. Tests in
  `backend/tests/test_bybit_usdt_perpetual_evidence.py`. No Bybit credentials.

## AT-ADR-069 — Confirmed Watcher setup continues to one internal paper fill
- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The activation runbook expects a genuine Watcher `CONFIRMED_SETUP`
  to reach an open paper Journal trade. The worker stopped after the Candidate.
  Eligibility, the canonical TradePlan, and the paper fill were composed only
  in tests.
- **Decision:**
  1. `AutomatedPaperLoop` sequences the existing ActionEligibility service,
     `CanonicalTradePlanService`, hash-bound API approval, and internal paper
     fill. It is not a second setup or risk authority.
  2. The loop runs only for paper mode, `ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=false`, and
     `EXCHANGE_MODE=paper_internal`. The fill source is `paper_internal`.
     Replay, `WATCH`, `NO_SETUP`, stale evidence, provider outage, a wrong
     tenant, a wrong strategy lineage, risk `BLOCK`, and the kill switch
     create no fill.
  3. One Candidate produces at most one plan and one fill. A duplicate scan
     and a later call with the same Candidate converge on that journal trade.
  4. This change does not arm Watcher, Telegram, or live trading, and does
     not add an Alembic revision.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep the manual test composition as the
  production path (rejected: the activation runbook cannot observe an open
  journal trade). Invoke Watcher side-effect ports from the orchestrator
  (rejected: those ports stay unused by orchestration).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. Risk `BLOCK` stays final. No exchange
  mutation and no Telegram execution authority.
- **Consequences:** Focused tests live in
  `backend/tests/test_automated_paper_loop.py`. Do not deploy or activate.

## AT-ADR-070 — Failover perpetual evidence reports the active market-data kind
- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Staging startup registers the perpetual evidence source through
  `_PerpetualEvidenceAdapter`, which copies `inner.kind`. `FailoverPerpetualSource`
  had a venue `name` and no provider kind, so Render raised
  `AttributeError: 'FailoverPerpetualSource' object has no attribute 'kind'`
  while building the default provider registry. Binance USD-M and Bybit USDT
  perpetual sources already report `ProviderKind.MARKET_DATA`.
- **Decision:** `kind` is the provider capability, not the venue. The failover
  wrapper adopts `kind` from the active source and updates it on switch and on
  return to the primary. Construction requires both sources to report
  `ProviderKind.MARKET_DATA`. A hardcoded kind that ignores the sources is not
  the contract. Venue provenance stays on the instrument and source identity.
- **Alternatives considered:** Set `kind = ProviderKind.MARKET_DATA` on the
  wrapper without reading the sources (rejected: that only hides the startup
  error). Make the registry skip a missing kind (rejected: the source must
  satisfy the provider interface).
- **Safety impact:** Paper only. No change to Watcher authority, Telegram,
  spot rejection, or fabricated-evidence rejection.
- **Consequences:** `PerpetualMarketSource` requires `kind`. Regression coverage
  builds `build_default_registry` and `create_app` with
  `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SOURCE=binance_usdm` and
  `PERPETUAL_EVIDENCE_SECONDARY_SOURCE=bybit_usdt_perpetual`.
