# Agent workflow

LangGraph orchestrates the AI trading workspace. Business logic lives in services; the graph routes state through deterministic nodes.

## Flow

```

## Key nodes (`backend/src/app/agents/nodes.py`)

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Guardrails | Injection, moderation, trading policy |
| RAG | Rules, playbook, **journal lessons** — never direct signals |
| Analytics | `analytics_summary_tool` for review questions (setups, mistakes, discipline) |
| Risk settings | `risk_settings_tool` for settings, discipline score, open paper trades, daily PnL — updates require confirmation |
| Strategy / pre-trade (Slice 33–39) | `strategy_workflow_tools` node routes workspace intents to registered tools |
| Market data | Read-only ticker/OHLCV via provider abstraction |
| Strategies | Seven deterministic MVP setups |
| Risk gate | 15 rules; `BLOCK` stops paper execution |
| Approval decision | Low confidence, execute intent, risk flags |
| Response builder | Deterministic structured output (source of truth) |
| Narrative enhancement | Optional LLM polish — schema-validated; falls back on failure |

## Persistence (Slice 13–20)

When a trade-related intent produces a proposal:

1. `ProposalService.create_from_agent` persists the plan
2. `ApprovalService.create_for_proposal` when approval required
3. Audit + usage events emitted
4. Frontend loads `/proposals/{id}/workflow` and `/approvals/{id}/workflow`

## Paper execution path

1. User approves in UI or API
2. `ExecutionService.place_paper_order` validates:
   - Real trading disabled
   - Approval status `approved`
   - Risk not `BLOCK`
   - Idempotency key
3. Paper order + position created
4. Audit event `paper_order_created`

**Rejected**, **needs_more_analysis**, and **modified** approvals cannot execute.

## Journal → RAG loop

When `JOURNAL_RAG_SYNC_ENABLED=true` (default):

1. Journal create/update triggers `JournalRagSyncService`
2. Entry text ingested as `trade_journal` with symbol/timeframe/tags metadata
3. Agent `retrieve_for_agent` includes `TRADE_JOURNAL` source type

See [rag_system.md](rag_system.md). Analytics summaries are not auto-ingested; see [trading_analytics.md](trading_analytics.md).

## Strategy workflow routing (Slice 34)

Deterministic intent detection (`strategy_intent.py`) routes workspace questions before generic `PLAN_TRADE`:

| User question pattern | Intent | Tool |
|-----------------------|--------|------|
| Build strategy card | `strategy_card` | `strategy_library_tool` |
| Analyze with my strategy | `pre_trade` | `pretrade_analysis_tool` |
| Position size | `position_size` | `position_sizing_tool` |
| Invalidation / stop | `invalidation_query` | `pretrade_analysis_tool` |
| Loss acceptable? | `loss_acceptance` | `position_sizing_tool` + acceptance guidance |
| Manual levels | `manual_levels` | `manual_levels_tool` |
| Human vs system | `human_vs_system` | `human_vs_system_tool` |
| Validated strategies | `strategy_status` | `strategy_library_tool` |
| Backtest next / run backtest | `backtest_run` | `backtest_tool` |
| Backtest results / what did backtest show | `backtest_results` | `backtest_tool` |
| Paper eligible? / why not validated | `backtest_eligibility` | `backtest_tool` |
| Backtest queue (legacy) | `backtest_queue` | `strategy_library_tool` |
| Pending / accepted lessons | `lesson_pending_query` / `lesson_accepted_query` | `lesson_review_tool` |
| Accept / reject lesson | `lesson_accept` / `lesson_reject` | `lesson_review_tool` |
| Make strategy testable / runner rule | `strategy_testability` / `add_runner_rule` | `strategy_testability_tool` |
| Start paper validation | `paper_validation_start` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Scan strategy / paper signals | `paper_validation_scan` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Paper trades, metrics, validated status | `paper_validation_query` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Improve or retire recommendation | `paper_validation_recommend` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Paper scheduler status/tick | `paper_scheduler_query` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Paper alerts | `paper_alerts_query` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Alert delivery status / deliver pending | `alert_delivery_query` | `paper_validation_tool` |
| Market watcher status / scan | `market_watcher_query` | `paper_validation_tool` |

Pending lesson observations are labeled — agent cannot invent accepted rules. See [lesson_workflow.md](lesson_workflow.md).

Backtest intents call `backtest_tool`; paper validation intents call `paper_validation_tool` — both run deterministic engines. Scheduler, alert delivery, market watcher, and **market watcher bridge** questions also use `paper_validation_tool` (never LLM-invented status). State-changing actions (deliver pending, market watcher scan, **bridge tick**, scheduler tick) require explicit owner confirmation. The LLM explains results but cannot fabricate win rate, drawdown, signals, scheduler state, delivery status, bridge decisions, or promotion status. **No path places exchange orders.**

## Analytics questions (Slice 31)

Review-style messages route to `trading_analytics_retrieval`, which calls `analytics_summary_tool` (DB session required). The deterministic reply includes discipline score, repeated mistakes, and setup activity — not LLM-scored discipline.

## Risk settings questions (Slice 45)

Risk and discipline intents can call `risk_settings_tool`:

| Question | Action |
| --- | --- |
| What are my risk settings? | `get` |
| Set max trades per day to 3 | `update` with `confirm=true` |
| What is my discipline score today? | `discipline_score` |
| Why is my daily lock active? | `loss_lock_reason` |
| How many paper trades are open? | `open_trades` |
| What is my paper PnL today? | `paper_pnl` |

State-changing `update` requires explicit user confirmation — same mutation policy as lesson accept and scheduler tick.

## API endpoints

- `POST /chat/message` — run agent
- `GET /proposals/{id}/workflow` — proposal + linked approval + eligibility
- `GET /approvals/{id}/workflow` — approval + linked proposal + eligibility
- `POST /execution/paper` — paper order (trader role)

## Narrative layer (Slice 21)

After `final_response` builds `TradingAnalysisDetail`, `narrative_enhancement`:

1. Builds sanitized JSON context (analysis, approval, market data quality, citations)
2. Loads external prompt (`backend/prompts/*.txt`)
3. Calls LLM via provider abstraction (mock without API key)
4. Validates narrative against deterministic facts and trading language policy
5. On failure → deterministic fallback narrative + audit warning
6. Formats combined reply for `output_validation`

The UI shows **Deterministic analysis** and **Narrative explanation** separately so users see that the LLM did not make the trade decision.

## Safety invariants

- Agent never calls exchange execution directly
- LLM output validated; never bypasses risk or approval
- LLM narrative cannot change risk level, approval status, or execution state
- Real trading requires explicit config not enabled in MVP
