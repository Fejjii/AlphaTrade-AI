# BloFin experiment resolver/outcome focused verification

Base: PR241 `6ca6a76201547524275266dfa22fdf12f5932b14`.
Branch: `codex/blofin-experiment-outcomes`. Exact published feature SHA is recorded in
the PR and dedicated handoff; this ledger is included in that commit.

The focused PostgreSQL fixture creates/drops only UUID-named schemas on disposable
local PostgreSQL 17.11. Native account verification reuses the existing MockTransport
manual-account fixture; new canonical commands, manifests and native facts are stored
synthetic fixtures. No actual exchange connection, order, balance change or activation.
All new cases execute on PostgreSQL, including existing a11 append-only guards and
account attribution locking. No SQLite substitution or skipped PostgreSQL evidence.

Original PR245 revision `93af3b27e2a5002b74e3dc38499d081d22dfe772` affected selection:
**179 passed in 54.29s, no skips**, including **71 new
PostgreSQL cases**. Selection covers the resolver/outcome and actual domain consumer,
existing domain/native identity/API/concurrency/migration, and native activity provider/
durability regressions. Full backend CI/release acceptance, deployment and runtime
activation are outside this task.

Run from `backend` with its development environment installed. Both opt-in PostgreSQL
URLs point to the disposable fixture database; schema isolation is provided by tests:

```sh
EXPERIMENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql+psycopg://experiment_fixture@127.0.0.1:55439/experiment_outcomes_test \
BLOFIN_ACTIVITY_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql+psycopg://experiment_fixture@127.0.0.1:55439/experiment_outcomes_test \
python -m pytest \
  tests/test_blofin_experiment_outcomes_postgres.py \
  tests/test_experiment_domain.py tests/test_experiment_native_identity.py \
  tests/test_experiment_concurrency.py tests/test_experiment_api.py \
  tests/test_experiment_migration.py tests/test_blofin_activity_postgres.py \
  tests/test_blofin_activity_provider.py --tb=short --show-capture=no
```

Changed Python files passed Ruff lint/format (7 files); scoped strict mypy passed on
the 6 new source/example/exporter files. Pure module serialization export `--check`
passed. The existing offline OpenAPI exporter produced bytes identical to the PR241
shared client artifact. No shared generator input/artifact or migration changed.
`git diff --check` passed.

Original PR245 contract SHA256:

- Module JSON Schema: `e568e0fc772d6b381c263485c3a56ebdc59b2bcb770eda68e17d8c9a6fc748ce`.
- Unchanged shared OpenAPI: `6f7f9ece7248442b53f9e3ebd84277053db284d1e52cf97a18a25ac5c4dcf0e3`.

Important capabilities exercised: exact attribution IDs/hashes, manual/echo rejection,
partial terminal entry and multiple exits, fee sign/rebates and unknown fee currency/
profit/methodology, duplicate pages/attestations, conflicting fill IDs, delayed receipts,
future-time refusal, coverage gaps/staleness, same-UID credential rotation, tenant/source
isolation, exclusive exit attribution, PostgreSQL serialization, fresh Validation start,
changed sample revalidation, insufficient sample nulls, multi-outcome Decimal aggregation,
18-place rounded win rate, large monetary values and caller-context independence.

The module-level integration example calls actual ExperimentService sample admission
and reads reconciled native performance. It performs no second collection or IO. Shared
HTTP wiring/generated contracts remain Agent 1's integration step. No trusted runtime
attestation producer is installed; undocumented native monetary semantics and protected
exit ancestry remain explicitly unavailable. Actual signed demo GET connectivity,
permissions, rotation, endpoint coverage/retention, fees/PnL basis and protected parent
lineage are unverified under enforced egress limits. No premium provider or paid data.

## Opening-entry and position-lineage correction

Read-only probes against the original PR245 resolver found that a reducing or unknown
entry and an entry fill reporting nonzero closing PnL all returned available. The resolver
now requires explicit reduceOnly false, rejects nonzero entry closing PnL, and requires
strict, affirmative server attestations of pre-entry flat inventory and complete native
flat-to-open-to-flat position ancestry. Unknown, absent, false or nonboolean claims remain
unavailable. No HTTP resolver installation, attestation producer, exchange action or runtime
activation was added. Fixture assertions are synthetic and establish no native performance.

Focused corrected selection: **87 passed in 70.59s, zero skips**, comprising all 71 existing
PostgreSQL outcome cases and 16 new opening/position regression cases. It used UUID-named
schemas on disposable local PostgreSQL 17.11 and executed:

```sh
EXPERIMENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql+psycopg://alphatrade@127.0.0.1:55439/alphatrade_test \
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -o addopts='' \
  tests/test_blofin_experiment_outcomes_postgres.py -q -rs
```

All 71 existing cases, including partial terminal entries, multiple exits, monetary math,
original receipts, exclusive attribution and PostgreSQL locking, remain in this selection.
No full suite or CI dispatch was run. Original PR245's broader 179-case evidence covers its
original revision; it is not acceptance of this correction or the combined integration SHA.

Changed-file Ruff lint/format passed for the three edited Python files. Scoped strict mypy
passed for the two edited source files. Pure module serialization export/check passed;
corrected schema SHA256:
`0d2ca13605f9542c29e0232c6edf29883186b2cc8a95b0015386b0457c122870`.
Shared HTTP artifacts and historical migrations were not edited. `git diff --check` passed.
The integration handoff records the exact corrective and combined commits.

Remaining native prerequisite: a reviewed server-owned producer must prove exact native
pre-entry inventory and complete position/exit ancestry without manual inventory or cost
basis mixing, and independently verify contract/PnL/fee allocation. Native account checks,
exchange permissions/coverage and monetary semantics remain unverified. HTTP sample admission
must stay unavailable and Strategies performance must stay explicit about unavailable data.
