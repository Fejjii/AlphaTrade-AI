# Next batch: authored experiments and durable research

PR244 uses `codex/experiments-market-integration`. PR237 remains frozen at
`3600ec89e48a6f3cf2f29b4468ab124d1219f627`; its staging smoke instructions are unchanged.
This milestone resumes published PR244 `ba627c69d8d08d266428e68a85b1aab80efda5e5`.
The final exact candidate is recorded in PR244 and the existing cloud handoff;
this document does not embed a self-referencing commit SHA.

| Included work | Reviewed feature SHA | Integrated scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR241 | `6ca6a76201547524275266dfa22fdf12f5932b14` | Immutable bounded domain, approval/lifecycle API, a11 |
| PR242 | `88ce82ff620c8fd206154a2e8593d242bad83e5c` | Canonical public evidence and corrected acquisition clocks |
| PR243 | `8b9d1b83ee5c4082d87005afbfdfa8343d286a7e` | Published pure receipt-timing correction |
| PR245 | `93af3b27e2a5002b74e3dc38499d081d22dfe772` | Trusted native resolver foundation; admission stays closed |
| PR246 | `62a20bb3759b3972fe935b8f05e25c21a84e8224` | Bounded durable screening, authenticated reads, immutable a12 |

Both new contributions were fetched, reviewed against their contracts/handoffs and
qualified on disposable PostgreSQL before integration. No sibling branch was
rewritten. Integration corrections additionally close opening/position lineage,
local authoring validation and request recovery issues; they grant no runtime authority.

## Connected product path

The recovery lifecycle correction resumes reviewed `48ca2e68`. Its fixed acceptance
denominator is six: L1 actual login establishes the recovery session; L2 both draft
and screening retain requests after server commit with lost/malformed replies; L3
reload retains the exact body/key; L4 explicit recovery resolves the original record
without duplication or automatic retries; L5 logout off-panel and reauthentication/
account change invalidate old pending state; L6 storage denial cannot prevent auth
cleanup. **L1–L6: 6/6 accepted locally**, implemented and integrated; deployment and
live acceptance remain unexecuted. The older injected-token browser evidence did not
qualify L1/L3/L5; two actual-login browser regressions now close those gaps. This is
overlapping repair acceptance, not six additional independent product features.

The existing Agent/document capture is the authoring entry. A complete typed research
spec can be captured as JSON or a fenced JSON block. Every binding and parameter must
be explicit. Incomplete, conflicting or malformed recognized contracts remain invalid
through persisted proposal confirmation: generic keyword rules cannot conceal the
failure. Correction creates a new reviewable proposal. Existing explicit confirmation,
content hashes, tenant identity and immutable strategy versions remain authoritative.
A new TrendPulse strategy is `manual_review`; no executable compiler is registered.

The saved strategy page offers a collapsed bounded experiment draft using actual
`GET /strategies/{id}/versions`, `GET /execution/accounts/paper` and `POST /experiments`.
It requires an existing enabled paper account and a supported immutable authored
version. It takes explicit USDT bounds, Exploration/Validation and setup-observation
limits. One baseline copies the exact authored parameters/symbol/timeframes. Models
remain disabled. It neither registers an account nor invents a native proof or risk
envelope. Creating or starting a domain experiment does not activate trading.

The actual `/strategies` route opens the created experiment, shows compact cards,
latest lifecycle, recent activity and unavailable performance, and renders durable
TrendPulse screenings with status, rejection reason, receipt provenance and time.
Recent history is bounded to five rows; details contain technical IDs and evidence.
Back returns to screening history or experiment cards. Native samples, signals and
internal simulation remain separate; signals never become trades or portfolio returns.
Existing approval/lifecycle operations use exact versions and expected revisions.
Owner approval remains a server boundary; no UI approval bypass was introduced.

Draft and screening requests validate complete generated bodies before storing pending
state. Definite first-attempt application refusals release the editable form. Timeouts,
interrupted connections, malformed successful responses and unresolved concurrency
conflicts retain exact original payloads and keys. Explicit recovery never automatically
reissues transport. Rejection of a recovery attempt cannot prove the original did not
commit, so it retains that identity. Pending state survives a tab reload and is scoped
to organization/user/session/version. Authentication binds a non-secret persisted
UUID only after login or verified `/auth/me`; reload restores it for the same identity,
and token refresh preserves it. Fresh login, logout and confirmed account changes
centrally invalidate both recovery namespaces even with no panel mounted. The memory
generation remains exclusively a cancellation/remount fence. A recovery scope requires
successful identity persistence; failure cannot permit an unrecoverable mutation.
Storage denial or a failing listener cannot interrupt local token/marker/identity
cleanup or subsequent listeners. Foreign-tenant reads/writes return404.

Shared generation adds three screening operations plus authored versions/paper account
to the existing pilot clients. Full combined OpenAPI SHA256:
`1955b672b6ed3099a3043f4fe4d23419182880b5bd3d19e70b848de9cff279bb`.
Pilot SHA256: `2acfa70b817e7665fb05afa26eccd374e0a90478f62d7bc46795ab63f2bff681`.
Multiple path parameters and 201 success handling preserve existing signatures.

## Native trust and performance boundary

PR245 is a trusted-resolver foundation, not an attestation producer. Integration
requires a server-owned literal-true proof of a flat position before the opening
entry and a complete flat→open→flat exit ancestry with no unrelated inventory/fills.
The resolver rejects reducing/unknown entries, nonzero opening realized PnL, unproved
position lineage, foreign/manual activity and receipt/source mismatches. Existing
closing-fill aggregation counts each owned native fill once, preserves contracts,
known fee currency and unknown costs/PnL. Simulation never supplies native proof.
The pure contract SHA256 is
`0d2ca13605f9542c29e0232c6edf29883186b2cc8a95b0015386b0457c122870`.

No verified server-owned producer is installed. HTTP sample admission remains503,
no native performance endpoint is enabled and performance stays unavailable. Real
opening position, exit ancestry, contract metadata, fee/funding and PnL reconciliation
must be accepted from actual native evidence before admission can open. No exchange
order/read credential or operator setting was used for local qualification.

PR246's published untuned four-regime synthetic replay records192 no-setups/zero
signals. That report proves no strategy performance. The local browser separately
uses a tagged positive synthetic fixture to exercise persistence and recovery;
its research signal grants no execution authority or admitted sample.

## Migration order and retained-schema rollback

There is one head, `a12trendpulsescreen001`:

```text
a8agentcapture001 -> a9knowledgeoutbox001 -> a10blofinactivity001
                 -> a11experiments001 -> a12trendpulsescreen001
```

The a11 and a12 files are byte-identical to the reviewed feature revisions. Earlier
migration files are unchanged. Do not stamp the database or create a parallel head.
Hosted read-only metadata on10October verified Render PostgreSQL
`dpg-d8fuok57vvec739lm0u0-a` (`alphatrade-postgres-staging`, PostgreSQL18) at
`a8agentcapture001`: documents exist; outbox, native facts, experiments and screenings
do not yet exist. This is database metadata, not proof of the API's secret connection
binding; verify that binding securely inside the authorized release executor.

The disposable PostgreSQL17 retained-schema probe creates five documents/chunks,
pending/processing/ready/failed jobs and a deletion tombstone; native account/facts/
cursors; experiment versions/events/sample; and actual qualified, duplicate and
refused screening rows. Both plain b165 and bda packages refuse unknown a12. An
archived bda package with byte-identical a10/a11/a12 migration overlays performs a
no-op upgrade, passes mock API startup/health and disarmed worker probes twice,
and preserves exact row snapshots. Returning to the integrated source preserves
those snapshots. Retained snapshot SHA256:
`d1423d9f61b9b6ce6227e08ce2cc61f945d37ba624aef3be242079aed2ec7a31`.
This is local source/startup proof, not a built hosted image or armed-worker acceptance.

Coordinated rollback sequence:

1. Use the separately authorized existing write hold. Stop new writes, drain requests
   and current consumers, preserving captured operator settings and checkpoints.
   Prevent old synchronous ingestion writers from overlapping the outbox consumer.
2. Verify a restorable database/provider snapshot and tenant-scoped inventories.
   **Retain populated a12.** Its downgrade deletes screening history; a11 deletes
   experiment state and a10/a9 delete native/outbox state. Never use plain b165 as
   rollback compatibility proof, and never stamp or downgrade to hide a mismatch.
3. Select separately built/tested migration-aware API and worker images carrying
   every retained revision through a12, using the qualified bda overlay manifest.
   The worker must remain disarmed unless its existing authorized behavior has
   separately passed compatibility checks. Retain the schema during image rollback.
4. Coordinate API, worker and a verified compatible frontend artifact/API binding.
   Check exact installed commits, expected/database a12, paper health, ownership
   reads and retained row/cursor inventories before reopening writes.
5. Restore only the previously approved settings and one compatible indexing consumer.
   Resume existing jobs with their original identities, not duplicate ingestion.
   No order, Telegram message, provider activation or configuration reset is implied.

These are focused results, not full backend acceptance. Initial PR244 CI38083209763
had928 backend passes and one cache failure; PR246 CI38084766737 completed418 backend
passes but one voice frontend failure. Their green jobs were inspected, not rerun or
attributed as acceptance of newer code. The two repaired regressions preserve actual
TTL freshness, concurrent collection/copy independence and actual voice readiness.
Strict mypy on the two authoring services and hardened resolver sources, changed-file
Ruff/format, frontend typecheck/ESLint, generated API/pure-schema drift and one-head
checks pass. Late authoring annotations/local variable renames preserve tested behavior.
Automatic focused CI38088701542 at e81bcb28 reported354 frontend passes and one
new recovery-test failure: the test clicked the pending Recover control before the
first request finished and it became enabled. Both analogous tests now await actual
readiness; all20 affected component cases pass. No product behavior changed. The
backend result and corrective candidate's focused CI are recorded separately in the
PR/checkpoint. No earlier run is acceptance of the corrected revision.

Reproduction uses explicitly disposable loopback PostgreSQL `alphatrade_test`:

```sh
# backend; never a hosted DATABASE_URL
EXPERIMENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL="$disposable_url" .venv/bin/pytest -o addopts='' -q -rs \
  tests/test_research_authoring_integration.py tests/test_strategy_conversation_foundation.py
PR237_ROLLBACK_POSTGRES_URL="$disposable_url" .venv/bin/pytest -o addopts='' -q -rs \
  tests/test_pr237_migration_aware_rollback.py
# frontend
npx vitest run src/components/strategies/ExperimentDraftPanel.test.tsx \
  src/components/strategies/ScreeningsPanel.test.tsx src/lib/api/research.test.ts \
  'src/app/(app)/strategy-lab/[id]/page.test.tsx'
```

`backend/scripts/research_browser_fixture.py` refuses non-loopback/disarmed/mock
settings and overrides only the real screening service's acquisition dependency
with tagged synthetic receipts. It never changes production operator flags or makes
public-provider calls. Seed short-lived private auth using the existing loopback-only
seeder, start this fixture API plus the actual frontend, and run only the authoring
phase of `frontend/ui-tests/research-api.spec.ts`. Stop that owned API process, retain
PostgreSQL, restart the same source in a new process, then run only the restart phase.
An explicit fixture header proves the process changed; lack of prerequisites fails
these selected tests. Browser state restores once, so reload cannot resurrect a
successfully resolved pending request. Screenshots contain synthetic content only.
The existing lifecycle browser evidence on ba627 is retained for unchanged lifecycle
operations; it is not current hosted or full-suite acceptance.

For the recovery correction, reseed with the existing guarded seeder, then run only
`ui-tests/auth-recovery-api.spec.ts` using those same loopback API/frontend URLs and
`EXPERIMENT_BROWSER_AUTH_FILE`. It never injects tokens, cookies or recovery state.
Authentication waits for protected-shell readiness before subsequent navigation.
Both synthetic accounts start with persisted **blocked** safety rows; only newly
created disposable tenants are initialized, with no operator row changed. During
initial qualification, concurrent lazy `GET /risk/kill-switch` inserts for an empty
synthetic organization caused a transaction-ID lock and blocked the local event loop.
The fixture now represents existing initialized account settings; production risk
code remains unchanged. Empty-tenant safety bootstrap is a separate observed issue,
not qualified or repaired here. Verify the smoke tenant's existing persisted safety
state through the authorized executor; never reset settings to manufacture a pass.
The initial private-file writer error and one session-loading/blocked-API browser
failure were diagnosed; the final selected run executes both cases with no skips.
Frontend typecheck/changed ESLint, seeder Ruff/format and diff whitespace checks pass.
Production backend, combined generated contracts and immutable migration tree are
byte-identical to `48ca2e68`; their valid prior evidence is reused, not rerun or
attributed as new full acceptance.

## Hosting receipt and one release access packet

Read-only Render access works in workspace `tea-d7hn0fvavr4c73f62c70`:

| Target | Verified configuration and live revision |
| --- | --- |
|API `alphatrade-api-staging` / `srv-d8fvbcd7vvec739mc060`|Tracks main; Docker backend; predeploy `alembic upgrade head`; liveb165b92276346f0e0fe3ccdbd2bec3443dc75d40, deploydep-db4gdkeq1p3s73a395u0|
|Worker `alphatrade-paper-worker-staging` / `srv-daqej7o473hc73fsc1k0`|Tracks main; `python -m app.workers.paper_worker`; same liveb165, deploydep-db4gdkeq1p3s73a3975g|
|PostgreSQL `alphatrade-postgres-staging` / `dpg-d8fuok57vvec739lm0u0-a`|Available PG18; read-only head a8 and table-presence metadata verified|
|Frontend|Current target/artifact/revision/API binding **unknown**. Historical projectprj_y7vFqwbFvdpHvf2nMaDkKQauBhZQ, teamteam_LNgcEGBkqntUnTrktNjFzh7a and aliashttps://alpha-trade-ai-eight.vercel.app are evidence to verify, not current deployment proof|

Never target the separate `ai-alphatrade-api-staging`. No deployment was attempted.
The available Render deploy connector accepts no commit; using it would deploy main,
not this candidate. No Render CLI/API credential, Vercel CLI/token or authenticated
synthetic staging token is bound to this executor. HTTPS probes to api.render.com,
the staging API and historical frontend returned proxy403. Vercel project listing
returned403 requiring reauthentication to scope `alphatrade-ai`; it does not establish
that the project/secret is absent. Read-only database access is available; write-hold,
container execution, backup/restore and migration execution are unqualified.

One concrete action packet for the existing release/access administrator:

- Bind the already established Render exact-commit executor (API/CLI or existing
  authorized release runner) to this workspace and the two exact service IDs, with
  HTTPS to api.render.com and https://alphatrade-api-staging.onrender.com. Current
  service-scoped MCP read access cannot select a deployment commit. Do not change
  tracked branches, merge main or create infrastructure to work around this.
- Reauthenticate the existing Vercel connector/CLI for the historical team/project
  scope; allow api.vercel.com and the verified frontend/protection path. Resolve
  the actual staging project/artifact/API binding before any promotion. Bind the
  existing protected-deployment access where required; never assume an alias is staging.
- Bind a scoped synthetic staging tenant/token through the executor's existing secure
  secret configuration, plus existing container/write-hold/backup/restore permissions
  for the verified API/worker/database. Record exact identity references securely;
  do not paste secret values into chat. Database reads already work and need no new
  generic credentials request.

This packet enables the blocked exact-ref deploy, frontend identity/binding verification,
coordinated backup/drain/migration and authenticated hosted smoke. It grants no runtime,
provider, exchange, Telegram, billing or kill-switch changes.

## Prepared staging order and workstream status

1. Supervising review freezes the exact PR244 candidate and accepts the rollback
   source/image manifest. Preserve frozen PR237 independently. Capture current operator
   flags/account identity/providers securely without resetting render.yaml defaults.
2. Through the established authorized release executor, verify API/worker database
   binding, restorable snapshot, existing write hold and tenant-scoped inventories.
   Drain old ingestion/API writers and worker consumers before migration. Stop at a
   concrete blocker if the existing process cannot select this SHA without main merge.
3. Exact-commit deploy API `srv-d8fvbcd7vvec739mc060`; its predeploy upgrades a8→a9→a10→a11→a12.
   Require one database head a12 and matching packaged expected head, paper health and
   exact installed SHA. Retire old synchronous ingestion writers before resuming writes.
4. Exact-commit deploy worker `srv-daqej7o473hc73fsc1k0` at that same SHA with captured
   existing command/settings. Verify one compatible outbox consumer and no old writer
   overlap. Previously disabled consumers/screening remain disabled; do not activate
   them merely to manufacture acceptance.
5. Build/deploy the verified existing frontend from the same SHA and existing approved
   API binding; verify team/project/deployment/environment, CORS/cookies and turn
   budget. Require API commit = worker commit = frontend Git source = frozen candidate,
   with database/code a12. No new project, alias guess or unreviewed main merge.
6. Execute the preserved [authenticated staging smoke](reviewer_wave/staging_smoke_sequence.md),
   plus this actual authoring/draft/history/recovery/tenant journey with synthetic content
   and read-only native checks. Disabled screening/indexing means that operation remains
   unaccepted; this task grants no activation. Keep the manual BloFin order incident
   undiagnosed absent actual request/server evidence.
7. Complete fresh required SFP diagnostics and naturally scheduled successful evaluations
   for approved scopes under existing settings. Neither local synthetic signals nor
   a startup heartbeat prove live scheduling or native performance.
8. After review, aligned staging acceptance and fresh SFP prerequisites, freeze the ref
   and dispatch the **single** final `.ai/RELEASE.md` gate with `full_backend=true` only
   under the explicit final acceptance request. Record exact SHA, all jobs/counts/skips.
   No such dispatch is justified while these hosted prerequisites are blocked.

Routine required PR checks remain focused; superseded PR runs cancel, and expensive
frontend build/evaluation/Docker/browser/full backend remain explicit manual gates.
No workflow protection is weakened. The attached playbook reconciles the existing
AGENTS/workflows/checkpoint: standing authority persists, routine implementation and
batched publication do not require approval loops, the owner collects up to two
workers directly, and missing access pauses only its operation. Protected release
and financial boundaries remain intact. Mac/iCloud access is unavailable here;
cloud publication source equality is verified separately without a downstream sync claim.

| Named milestone | Implemented | Integrated/local accepted | Deployed | Live accepted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focused CI repairs |2/2|2/2|Unexecuted|Unexecuted|
| Authoring-to-research journey |6/6|6/6|0/6|0/6|
| Trust and privacy |4/4 safeguards|4/4 safeguards; native performance unqualified|0/4|0/4|
| Migration/release preparation |4/4|4/4|0/4|0/4|

All local capabilities remain undeployed. Remaining external dependencies are the
single access packet, verified rollback images/armed-worker compatibility, supervising
review, aligned staging smoke/fresh SFP, final full gate and a separately verified
native attestation producer before any sample/performance activation.

## Active milestone contract — 10 October 2026

Accountable owner: current integration agent; two isolated repair workers maximum.
Starting candidate: ba627c69d8d08d266428e68a85b1aab80efda5e5. Published contributions
under review: PR245 93af3b27e2a5002b74e3dc38499d081d22dfe772 and PR246
62a20bb3759b3972fe935b8f05e25c21a84e8224. PR237 stays frozen at
3600ec89e48a6f3cf2f29b4468ab124d1219f627.

The following denominator is fixed before implementation. Report each milestone's
accepted/total separately for focused implementation, integrated local journey,
staging deployment and live acceptance. A local pass establishes no hosted pass.

- **Focused CI repairs (2):** R1 within-TTL Bybit consumers share one collection and
  TTL expiry still refreshes; R2 voice recording waits for actual conversation
  readiness and uses the same composer with an observable transcript.
- **Authoring-to-research journey (6):** J1 existing Agent/document capture persists
  an authored strategy; J2 that strategy can seed a bounded Exploration/Validation
  draft through actual APIs without an alternative authoring wizard; J3 existing
  approval/lifecycle boundaries persist and domain start grants no execution;
  J4 actual Strategies renders durable screening status/reasons and compact recent
  history with Back and technical evidence in details; J5 screening request identity
  survives an ambiguous reply and explicit recovery without automatic duplicate
  acquisition; J6 reload/fresh server sessions preserve screening outcomes and
  deduplicate the same request across restart.
- **Trust and privacy (4):** S1 account/tenant changes clear scoped UI state and
  foreign tenants cannot read/write these experiments or receipts; S2 PR245 stays a
  trusted-resolver foundation with HTTP native admission closed absent a verified
  server-owned attestation producer; S3 opening-entry/exit lineage, contract units,
  native position/monetary attribution and simulation separation are verified in
  focused contracts, with unavailable performance kept explicit; S4 synthetic replay
  with zero signals is labelled research evidence and never performance.
- **Migration and release preparation (4):** M1 reviewed contributions integrate
  with one immutable a8→a9→a10→a11→a12 ancestry and combined generated contracts;
  M2 disposable PostgreSQL retained-schema rollback preserves documents, jobs,
  native activity, experiments and actual screening history while plain old code
  refuses the new head; M3 existing instructions/checkpoint adopt autonomous delivery
  without routine approval/manual relay loops while retaining protected operations;
  M4 one focused hosting pass identifies exact targets, blocked operations and the
  coordinated staging/rollback sequence without changing settings.

Authority: focused implementation, isolated worker branches, integration and batched
publication to PR244. No main merge, deployment, provider activation, financial
transaction, external message, credential/operator mutation or full CI dispatch.
Final full backend gate remains after supervising review, staging and fresh SFP
prerequisites under .ai/RELEASE.md. Native attestations/execution are not authorized
by this milestone. No new paid model/resource, no new management system.
